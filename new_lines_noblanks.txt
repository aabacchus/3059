BOOK
XIII.
Foaeidon
stirreth
up
the
Achaians
to
defend
the
ships.
The
valour
of
Idomeneus.
Now
Zeus,
after
that
he
had
brought
the
Trojans
and
Hector
to
the
ships,
left
them
to
their
toil
and
endless
labour
there,
but
otherwhere
again
he
turned
his
shining
eyes,
and
looked
upon
the
land
of
the
Thracian
horsebreeders,
and
the
Mysians,
fierce
fighters
hand
to
hand,
and
the
proud
Hip-
pemolgoi
that
drink
mare's
milk,
and
the
Abioi,
the
most
righteous
of
men.
To
Troy
no
more
at
all
he
turned
his
shining
eyes,
for
he
deemed
in
his
heart
that
not
one
of
the
Immortals
would
draw
near,
to
help
either
Trojans
or
Danaans.
But
the
mighty
Earthshaker
held
no
blind
watch,
who
sat
and
marvelled
on
the
war
and
strife,
high
on
the
topmost
crest
of
wooded
Samothrace,
for
thence
all
Ida
was
plain
to
see
;
and
plain
to
see
were
the
city
of
Priam,
and
the
ships
of
the
Achaians.
Thither
did
he
go
from
the
sea
and
sate
him
down,
and
he
had
pity
on
the
Achaians,
that
they
were
subdued
to
the
Trojans,
and
strong
was
his
anger
against
Zeus.
Then
forthwith
he
went
down
from
the
rugged
hill,
faring
with
swift
steps,
and
the
high
hills
trembled,
and
the
woodland,
beneath
the
immortal
footsteps
of
Poseidon
as
he
moved.
Three
strides
he
made,
and
with
the
fourth
he
reached
his

ILIAD
XIII,
20-49.
goal,
even
Aigae,
and
there
was
his
famous
palace
in
the
deeps
of
the
mere,
his
glistering
golden
mansions
builded,
imperishable
for
ever.
Thither
went
he,
and
let
harness
to
the
car
his
bronze-hooved
horses,
swift
of
flight,
clothed
with
their
golden
manes.
He
girt
his
own
golden
array
about
his
body,
and
seized
the
well-wrought
lash
of
gold,
and
mounted
his
chariot,
and
forth
he
drove
across
the
waves.
And
the
sea
beasts
frolicked
beneath
him,
on
all
sides
out
of
the
deeps,
for
well
they
knew
their
lord,
and
with
gladness
the
sea
stood
asunder,
and
swiftly
they
sped,
and
the
axle
of
bronze
was
not
wetted
beneath,
and
the
bounding
steeds
bare
him
on
to
the
ships
of
the
Achaians.
Now
there
is
a
spacious
cave
in
the
depths
of
the
deep
mere,
between
Tenedos
and
rugged
Imbros
;
there
did
Po-
seidon,
the
Shaker
of
the
earth,
stay
his
horses,
and
loosed
them
out
of
the
chariot,
and
cast
before
them
ambrosia)
food
to
graze
withal,
and
golden
tethers
he
bound
about
their
hooves,
tethers
neither
to
be
broken
nor
loosed,
that
there
the
horses
might
continually
await
their
lord's
return.
And
he
went
to
the
host
of
the
Achaians.
Now
the
Trojans
like
flame
or
storm-wind
were
following
in
close
array,
with
fierce
intent,
after
Hector,
son
of
Priam.
With
shouts
and
cries
they
came,
and
thought
to
take
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
and
to
slay
thereby
all
the
bravest
of
the
host.
But
Poseidon,
that
girdleth
the
world,
the
Shaker
of
the
earth,
was
urging
on
the
Argives,
and
forth
he
came
from
the
deep
salt
sea,
in
form
and
untiring
voice
like
unto
Kalchas.
First
he
spake
to
the
two
Aiantes,
that
them-
selves
were
eager
for
battle
:
"
Ye
Aiantes
twain,
ye
shall
save
the
people
of
the
Achaians,
if
ye
are
mindful
of
your
might,
and
reckless
of
chill
fear.
For
verily
I
do
not
other-
where
dread
the
invincible
hands
of
the
Trojans,
that
have
climbed
the
great
wall
in
their
multitude,
nay,
the
well

greaved
Achaians
will
hold
them
all
at
bay
;
but
hereby
verily
do
I
greatly
dread
lest
some
evil
befall
us,
even
here
where
that
furious
one
is
leading
like
a
flame
of
fire,
Hector,
who
boasts
him
to
be
son
of
mighty
Zeus.
Nay,
but
here
may
some
god
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
you
twain,
to
stand
sturdily
yourselves,
and
urge
others
to
do
the
like
;
thereby
might
ye
drive
him
from
the
fleet
-faring
ships,
despite
his
eagerness,
yea,
even
if
the
Olympian
himself
is
rousing
him
to
war."
Therewith
the
Shaker
of
the
world,
the
girdler
of
the
earth,
struck
the
twain
with
his
staff,
and
filled
them
with
strong
courage,
and
their
limbs
he
made
light,
and
their
feet,
and
their
hands
withal.
Then,
even
as
a
swift-winged
hawk
speeds
forth
to
fly,
poised
high
above
a
tall
sheer
rock,
and
swoops
to
chase
some
other
bird
across
the
plain,
even
so
Poseidon
sped
from
them,
the
Shaker
of
the
world.
And
of
the
twain
Oileus'
son,
the
swift-footed
Aias,
was
the
first
to
know
the
god,
and
instantly
he
spake
to
Aias,
son
of
Telamon
:
"
Aias,
since
it
is
one
of
the
gods
who
hold
Olympus,
that
in
the
semblance
of
a
seer
commands
us
now
to
fight
beside
the
ships
—
not
Kalchas
is
he,
the
prophet
and
soothsayer,
for
easily
I
knew
the
tokens
of
his
feet
and
knees
as
he
turned
away,
and
the
gods
are
easy
to
discern
—
lo,
then
mine
own
heart
within
my
breast
is
more
eagerly
set
on
war
and
battle,
and
my
feet
beneath
and
my
hands
above
are
lusting
for
the
fight."
Then
Aias,
son
of
Telamon,
answered
him
saying
:
11
Even
so,
too,
my
hands
invincible
now
rage
about
the
spear
-shaft,
and
wrath
has
risen
within
me,
and
both
my
feet
are
swift
beneath
me;
yea,
I
am
keen
to
meet,
even
in
single
fight,
the
ceaseless
rage
of
Hector
son
of
Priam."
So
they
spake
to
each
other,
rejoicing
in
the
delight
248
ILIAD
XIII,
81-113,
of
battle,
which
the
god
put
in
their
heart.
Then
the
girdler
of
the
earth
stirred
up
the
Achaians
that
were
in
the
rear
and
were
renewing
their
strength
beside
the
swift
ships.
Their
limbs
were
loosened
by
their
grievous
toil,
yea,
and
their
souls
filled
with
sorrow
at
the
sight
of
the
Trojans,
that
had
climbed
over
the
great
wall
in
their
multitude.
And
they
looked
on
them,
and
shed
tears
beneath
their
brows,
thinking
that
never
would
they
escape
destruction.
But
the
Shaker
of
the
earth
right
easily
came
among
them,
and
urged
on
the
strong
battalions
of
warriors.
Teukros
first
he
came
and
summoned,
and
Leitos,
and
the
hero
Peneleos,
andThoas,
and
Deipyros,
andMeriones,and
Antilochos,
lords
of
the
war-cry,
all
these
he
spurred
on
with
winged
words
:
"
Shame
on
you,
Argives,
shame,
ye
striplings,
in
your
battle
had
I
trusted
for
the
salvation
of
our
ships.
But
if
you
are
to
withdraw
from
grievous
war,
now
indeed
the
day
doth
shine
that
shall
see
us
conquered
by
the
Trojans.
Out
on
it,
for
verily
a
great
marvel
is
this
that
mine
eyes
behold,
a
terrible
thing
that
methought
should
never
come
to
pass,
the
Trojans
advancing
against
our
ships
!
Of
yore
they
were
like
fleeting
hinds,
that
in
the
wild
wood
are
the
prey
of
jackals,
and
pards,
and
wolves,
and
wander
helpless,
strengthless,
empty
of
the
joy
of
battle.
Even
so
the
Trojans
of
old
cared
never
to
wait
and
face
the
wrath
and
the
hands
of
the
Achaians,
not
for
a
moment.
But
now
they
are
fighting
far
from
the
town,
by
the
hollow
ships,
all
through
the
baseness
of
our
leader
and
the
remissness
of
the
people,
who,
being
at
strife
with
the
chief,
have
no
heart
to
defend
the
swift-faring
ships,
nay,
thereby
they
are
slain.
But
if
indeed
and
in
truth
the
hero
Agamemnon,
the
wide-
ruling
son
of
Atreus,
is
the
very
cause
of
all,
for
that
he
did
dishonour
the
swift-footed
son
of
Peleus,
not
even
so
may
we
refrain
in
any
wise
from
war.
Nay,
let
us
right
our
fault

with
speed,
for
easily
righted
are
the
hearts
of
the
bra\&gt;
No
longer
do
ye
well
to
refrain
from
impetuous
might,
all
ye
that
are
the
best
men
of
the
host.
I
myself
would
not
quarrel
with
one
that,
being
a
weakling,
abstained
from
war,
but
with
you
I
am
heartily
wroth.
Ah,
friends,
soon
shall
ye
make
the
mischief
more
through
this
remissness,—
but
let
each
man
conceive
shame
in
his
heart,
and
indignation,
for
verily
great
is
the
strife
that
hath
arisen.
Ix),
the
mighty
Hector
of
the
loud
war-cry
is
fighting
at
the
ships,
and
the
gates
and
the
long
bar
he
hath
burst
in
sunder."
On
this
wise
did
the
Earth-enfolder
call
to
and
spur
on
the
Achaians.
And
straightway
they
made
a
stand
around
the
two
Aiantes,
strong
bands
that
Ares
himself
could
not
enter
and
make
light
of,
nor
Athene
that
marshals
the
host.
Yea,
they
were
the
chosen
best
that
abode
the
Trojans
and
goodly
Hector,
and
spear
on
spear
made
close-set
fence,
and
shield
on
serried
shield,
buckler
pressed
on
buckler,
and
helm
on
helm,
and
man
on
man.
The
horse-hair
crests
on
the
bright
helmet
-ridges
touched
each
other
as
they
nodded,
so
close
they
stood
each
by
other,
and
spears
brandished
in
bold
hands
were
interlaced
;
and
their
hearts
were
steadfast
and
lusted
for
battle.
Then
the
Trojans
drave
forward
in
close
array,
and
Hector
led
them,
pressing
straight
onwards,
like
a
rolling
rock
from
a
cliff,
that
the
winter-swollen
water
thrusteth
from
the
crest
of
a
hill,
having
broken
the
foundations
of
the
stubborn
rock
with
its
wondrous
flood
;
leaping
aloft
it
flies,
and
the
wood
echoes
under
it,
and
unstayed
it
runs
its
course,
till
it
reaches
the
level
plain,
and
then
it
rolls
no
more
for
all
its
eagerness,
—
even
so
Hector
for
a
while-
threatened
lightly
to
win
to
the
sea
through
the
huts
and
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
slaying
as
he
came,
but
when
he
encountered
the
serried
battalions,
he
was
stayed
when
he

drew
near
against
them.
But
they
of
the
other
part,
the
sons
of
the
Achaians,
thrust
with
their
swords
and
double-
pointed
spears,
and
drave
him
forth
from
them,
that
he
gave
ground
and
reeled
backward.
Then
he
cried
with
a
pierc-
ing
voice,
calling
on
the
Trojans
:
"
Trojans,
and
Lykians,
and
close-fighting
Dardanians,
hold
your
ground,
for
the
Achaians
will
not
long
ward
me
off,
nay,
though
they
have
arrayed
themselves
in
fashion
like
a
tower.
Rather,
me-
thinks,
they
will
flee
back
before
the
spear,
if
verily
the
chief
of
gods
has
set
me
on,
the
loud-thundering
lord
of
Hera."
Therewith
he
spurred
on
the
heart
and
spirit
of
each
man
;
and
Dei'phobos,
the
son
of
Priam,
strode
among
them
with
high
thoughts,
and
held
in
front
of
him
the
circle
of
his
shield,
and
lightly
he
stepped
with
his
feet,
advancing
beneath
the
cover
of
his
shield.
Then
Meriones
aimed
at
him
with
a
shining
spear,
and
struck,
and
missed
not,
but
smote
the
circle
of
the
bulls'-hide
shield,
yet
no
whit
did
he
pierce
it
;
nay,
well
ere
that
might
be,
the
long
spear-shaft
snapped
in
the
socket.
Now
Deiphobos
was
holding
off
from
him
the
bulls'-hide
shield,
and
his
heart
feared
the
lance
of
wise
Meriones,
but
that
hero
shrunk
back
among
the
throng
of
his
comrades,
greatly
in
wrath
both
for
the
loss
of
victory,
and
of
his
spear,
that
he
had
shivered.
So
he
set
forth
to
go
to
the
huts
and
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
to
bring
a
long
spear,
that
he
had
left
in
his
hut.
Meanwhile
the
others
were
fighting
on,
and
there
arose
an
inextinguishable
cry.
First
Teukros,
son
of
Telamon,
slew
a
man,
the
spearman
Imbrios,
the
son
of
Mentor
rich
in
horses.
In
Pedaion
he
dwelt,
before
the
coming
of
the
sons
of
the
Achaians,
and
he
had
for
wife
a
daughter
of
Priam,
born
out
of
wedlock,
Medesikaste
;
but
when
the
curved
ships
of
the
Danaans
came,
he
returned
again
to
Ilios,
and

was
pre-eminent
among
the
Trojans,
and
dwelt
with
Priam,
who
honoured
him
like
his
own
children.
Him
the
son
of
Telamon
pierced
below
the
ear
with
his
long
lance,
and
plucked
back
the
spear.
Then
he
fell
like
an
ash
that
on
the
crest
of
a
far-seen
hill
is
smitten
with
the
axe
of
bronze,
and
brings
its
delicate
foliage
to
the
ground
;
even
so
ho
fell,
and
round
him
rang
his
armour
bedight
with
bronze.
Then
Teukros
rushed
forth,
most
eager
to
strip
his
armour,
and
Hector
cast
at
him
as
he
came
with
his
shining
spear.
But
Teukros,
steadily
regarding
him,
avoided
by
a
little
the
spear
of
bronze;
so
Hector
struck
Amphimachos,
son
of
Kteatos,
son
of
Aktor,
in
the
breast
with
the
spear,
as
he
was
returning
to
the
battle.
With
a
crash
he
fell,
and
his
armour
rang
upon
him.
Then
Hector
sped
forth
to
tear
from
the
head
of
great-
hearted
Amphimachos
the
helmet
closely
fitted
to
his
tem-
ples,
but
Aias
aimed
at
Hector
as
he
came,
with
a
shining
spear,
yet
in
no
wise
touched
his
body,
for
he
was
all
clad
in
dread
armour
of
bronze;
but
he
smote
the
boss
of
his
shield,
and
drave
him
back
by
main
force,
and
he
gave
place
from
behind
the
two
dead
men,
and
the
Achai-
ans
drew
them
out
of
the
battle.
So
Stichios
and
goodly
Menestheus,
leaders
of
the
Athenians,
conveyed
Amphi-
machos
back
among
the
host
of
the
Achaians,
but
Imbrios
the
two
Aiantes
carried,
with
hearts
full
of
impetuous
might.
And
as
when
two
lions
have
snatched
away
a
goat
from
sharp-toothed
hounds,
and
carry
it
through
the
deep
thicket,
holding
the
body
on
high
above
the
ground
in
their
jaws,
so
the
two
warrior
Aiantes
held
Imbrios
aluft
and
spoiled
his
arms.
Then
the
son
of
Oileus
cut
his
head
from
his
delicate
neck,
in
wrath
for
the
sake
of
Amphi
machos,
and
sent
it
rolling
like
a
ball
through
the
throng,
and
it
dropped
in
the
dust
before
the
feet
of
Hector.

Then
verily
was
Poseidon
wroth
at
heart,
when
his
son's
son
fell
in
the
terrible
fray/
So
he
set
forth
to
go
by
the
huts
and
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
to
spur
on
the
Danaans,
and
sorrows
he
was
contriving
for
the
Trojans.
Then
Idomeneus,
spearman
renowned,
met
him
on
his
way
from
his
comrade
that
had
but
newly
returned
to
him
out
of
the
battle,
wounded
on
the
knee
with
the
sharp
bronze.
Him
his
comrades
carried
forth,
and
Idomeneus
gave
charge
to
the
leeches,
and
so
went
on
to
his
hut,
for
he
still
was
eager
to
face
the
war.
Then
the
mighty
Shaker
of
the
earth
addressed
him,
in
the
voice
of
Thoas,
son
of
Andrai-
inon,
that
ruled
over
the
Aitolians
in
all
Pleuron,
and
mountainous
Kalydon,
and
was
honoured
like
a
god
by
the
people
:
"
Idomeneus,
thou
counsellor
of
the
Cretans,
say,
whither
have
thy
threats
fared,
wherewith
the
sons
of
the
Achaians
threatened
the
Trojans
?
"
Then
Idomeneus,
leader
of
the
Cretans,
answered
him
again
:
"
O
Thoas,
now
is
there
no
man
to
blame,
that
I
wot
of,
for
we
all
are
skilled
in
war.
Neither
is
there
any
man
that
spiritless
fear
holds
aloof,
nor
any
that
gives
place
to
cowardice,
and
shuns
the
cruel
war,
nay,
but
even
thus,
methinks,
must
it
have
seemed
good
to
almighty
Kronion,
even
that
the
Achaians
should
perish
nameless
here,
far
away
from
Argos.
But
Thoas,
seeing
that
of
old
thou
wert
staunch,
and
dost
spur
on
some
other
man,
wheresoever
thou
mayst
see
any
give
ground,
therefore
slacken
not
now,
but
call
aloud
to
every
warrior."
Then
Poseidon,
the
Shaker
of
the
earth,
answered
him
again
:
"
Idomeneus,
never
may
that
man
go
forth
out
of
Troy-land,
but
here
may
he
be
the
sport
of
dogs,
who
this
day
wilfully
is
slack
in
battle.
Nay,
come,
take
thy
weapons
and
away
:
herein
we
must
play
the
man
together,

avail
there
may
be,
though
we
are
no
more
than
two.
Ay,
and
very
cowards
get
courage
from
company,
but
we
twain
know
well
how
to
battle
even
with
the
brave.1'
Therewith
the
god
went
back
again
into
the
strife
of
men,
but
Idomeneus,
so
soon
as
he
came
to
his
well-builded
hut,
did
on
his
fair
armour
about
his
body,
and
grasped
two
spears,
and
set
forth
like
the
lightning
that
Kronion
seizes
in
his
hand
and
brandishes
from
radiant
Olympus,
showim-,
forth
a
sign
to
mortal
men,
and
far
seen
are
the
flames
thereof.
Even
so
shone
the
bronze
about
the
breast
of
Idomeneus
a.s
he
ran,
and
Meriones,
his
good
squire,
met
him,
while
he
was
still
near
his
hut,
—
he
was
going
to
bring
his
spear
of
bronze,
—
and
mighty
Idomeneus
spake
to
him
:
"
Meriones
son
of
Molos,
fleet
of
foot,
dearest
of
my
company,
where-
fore
hast
thou
come
hither
and
left
the
war
and
strife
?
Art
thou
wounded
at
all,
and
vexed
by
a
dart's
point,
or
dost
thou
come
with
a
message
for
me
concerning
aught
?
Verily
I
myself
have
no
desire
to
sit
in
the
huts,
but
to
fight."
Then
wise
Meriones
answered
him
again,
saying
:
"
[Ido
meneus,
thou
counsellor
of
the
mail-clad
Cretans,]
I
have
come
to
fetch
a
spear,
if
perchance
thou
hast
one
left
in
the
huts,
for
that
which
before
I
carried
I
have
shivered
in
casting
at
the
shield
of
proud
Deiphobos."
Then
Idomeneus,
leader
of
the
Cretans,
answered
him
again
:
"
Spears,
if
thou
wilt,
thou
shalt
find,
one,
ay,
and
twenty,
standing
in
the
hut,
against
the
shining
side
walls,
spears
of
the
Trojans
whereof
I
have
spoiled
their
slain.
Yea,
it
is
not
my
mood
to
stand
and
fight
with
foeinen
from
afar,
wherefore
1
have
spears,
and
bossy
shields,
and
helms,
and
corslets
of
splendid
sheen."
Then
wise
Meriones
answered
him
again
:
'
Yea,
and
in
mine
own
hut
and
my
black
ship
are
many
spoils
of
the
Trojans,
but
not
ready
to
my
hand.

neither
am
I
forgetful
of
valour
;
but
stand
forth
among
the
foremost
to
face
the
glorious
war,
whensoever
ariseth
the
strife
of
battle.
Any
other,
methinks,
of
the
mail-clad
Achaians
should
sooner
forget
my
prowess,
but
thou
art
he
that
knoweth
it"
Then
Idomeneus,
leader
of
the
Cretans,
answered
him
again
:
"
I
know
what
a
man
of
valour
thou
art,
wherefore
shouldst
thou
tell
me
thereof?
Nay,
if
now
beside
the
ships
all
the
best
of
us
were
being
chosen
for
an
ambush
—
wherein
the
valour
of
men
is
best
discerned
;
there
the
coward,
and
the
brave
man
most
plainly
declare
them-
selves
:
for
the
colour
of
the
coward
changes
often,
and
his
spirit
cannot
abide
firm
within
him,
but
now
he
kneels
on
one
knee,
now
on
the
other,
and
rests
on
either
foot,
and
his
heart
beats
noisily
in
his
breast,
as
he
thinks
of
doom,
and
his
teeth
chatter
loudly.
But
the
colour
of
the
brave
man
does
not
change,
nor
is
he
greatly
afraid,
from
the
moment
that
he
enters
the
ambush
of
heroes,
but
his
prayer
is
to
mingle
instantly
in
woful
war.
Were
we
being
chosen
for
such
ambush,
I
say,
not
even
then
would
any
man
reckon
lightly
of
thy
courage
and
thy
strength.
Nay,
and
even
if
thou
wert
stricken
in
battle
from
afar,
or
smitten
in
close
fight,
the
dart
would
not
strike
thee
in
the
hinder
part
of
the
neck,
nor
in
the
back,
but
would
encounter
thy
breast
or
belly,
as
thou
dost
press
on,
towards
the
gathering
of
the
foremost
fighters.
But
come,
no
more
let
us
talk
thus,
like
children,
loitering
here,
lest
any
man
be
vehemently
wroth,
but
go
thou
to
the
hut,
and
bring
the
strong
spear."
Thus
he
spake,
and
Meriones,
the
peer
of
swift
Ares,
quickly
bare
the
spear
of
bronze
from
the
hut,
and
went
after
Idomeneus,
with
high
thoughts
of
battle.
And
even
as
Ares,
the
bane
of
men,
goes
forth
into
the
war,
and
with
him
follows
his
dear
son
Panic,
stark
and
fearless,
that

255
terrifies
even
the
hardy
warrior;
and
these
twain
leave
Thrace,
and
harness
them
for
fight
with
the
Ephyri,
or
the
great-hearted
Phlegyans,
yet
hearken
not
to
both
peoples,
but
give
honour
to
one
only;
like
these
gods
did
Meriones
and
Idomeneus,
leaders
of
men,
set
forth
into
the
fight,
harnessed
in
gleaming
bronze.
And
Meriones
spake
first
to
Idomeneus
saying
:
"
Child
of
Deukalion,
whither
art
thou
eager
to
enter
into
the
throng
:
on
the
right
of
all
the
host,
or
in
the
centre,
or
on
the
left?
Ay,
and
no
other
where,
methinks,
are
the
flowing-haired
Achaians
so
like
to
fail
in
fight."
Then
Idomeneus,
the
leader
of
the
Cretans,
answered
him
again
:
"
In
the
centre
of
the
ships
there
are
others
to
bear
the
brunt,
the
two
Aiantes,
and
Teukros,
the
best
bowman
of
the
Achaians,
ay,
and
a
good
man
in
close
fight
;
these
will
give
Hector
Priam's
son
toil
enough,
how-
soever
keen
he
be
for
battle
;
yea,
though
he
be
exceeding
stalwart.
Hard
will
he
find
it,
with
all
his
lust
for
war,
to
overcome
their
strength
and
their
hands
invincible,
and
to
fire
the
ships,
unless
Kronion
himself
send
down
on
the
swift
ships
a
burning
brand.
But
not
to
a
man
would
he
yield,
the
great
Telamonian
Aias,
to
a
man
that
is
mortal
and
eateth
Demeter's
grain,
and
may
be
cloven
with
the
sword
of
bronze,
and
with
hurling
of
great
stones.
Nay,
not
even
to
Achilles
the
breaker
of
the
ranks
of
men
would
he
give
way,
not
in
close
fight;
but
for
speed
of
foot
none
may
in
any
wise
strive
with
Achilles.
But
guide
us
twain,
as
thou
sayest,
to
the
left
hand
of
the
host,
that
speedily
we
may
learn
whether
we
are
to
win
glory
from
others,
or
other
men
from
us."
So
he
spake,
and
Meriones,
the
peer
of
swift
Ares,
led
the
way,
till
they
came
to
the
host,
in
that
place
whither
he
bade
him
go.
256
ILIAD
XIII,
330-360.
And
when
the
Trojans
saw
Idomeneus,
strong
as
flame,
and
his
squire
with
him,
and
their
glorious
armour,
they
all
shouted
and
made
for
him
through
the
press.
Then
their
mellay
began,
by
the
sterns
of
the
ships.
And
as
the
gusts
speed
on,
when
shrill
winds
blow,
on
a
day
when
dust
lies
thickest
on
the
roads,
and
the
winds
raise
together
a
great
cloud
of
dust,
even
so
their
battle
clashed
together,
and
all
were
fain
of
heart
to
slay
each
other
in
the
press
with
the
keen
bronze.
And
the
battle,
the
bane
of
men,
bristled
with
the
long
spears,
the
piercing
spears
they
grasped,
and
the
glitter
of
bronze
from
gleaming
helmets
dazzled
the
eyes,
and
the
sheen
of
new-burnished
corslets,
and
shining
shields,
as
the
men
thronged
all
together.
Right
hardy
of
heart
would
he
have
been
that
joyed
and
sorrowed
not
at
the
sight
of
this
labour
of
battle.
Thus
the
two
mighty
sons
of
Kronos,
with
contending
will,
were
contriving
sorrow
and
anguish
for
the
heroes.
Zeus
desired
victory
for
the
Trojans
and
Hector,
giving
glory
to
swift
-
footed
Achilles
;
yet
he
did
not
wish
the
Achaian
host
to
perish
utterly
before
Ilios,
but
only
to
give
renown
to
Thetis
and
her
strong-hearted
son.
But
Poseidon
went
among
the
Argives
and
stirred
them
to
war,
stealing
secretly
forth
from
the
grey
salt
sea
:
for
he
was
sore
vexed
that
they
were
overcome
by
the
Trojans,
and
was
greatly
in
wrath
against
Zeus.
Verily
both
were
of
the
same
lineage
and
the
same
place
of
birth,
but
Zeus
was
the
elder
and
the
wiser.
Therefore
also
Poseidon
avoided
to
give
open
aid,
but
secretly
ever
he
spurred
them
on,
throughout
the
host,
in
the
likeness
of
a
man.
These
twain
had
strained
the
ends
of
the
cords
of
strong
strife
and
equal
war,
and
had
stretched
them
over
both
Trojans
and
Achaians,
a
knot
that
none
might
break
nor
undo,
for
the
loosening
of
the
knees
of
many.
ILIAD
XIII,
361-389.
257
Even
then
Idomeneus,
though
his
hair
was
flecked
with
grey,
called
on
the
Danaans,
and
leaping
among
the
Trojans,
roused
their
terror.
For
he
slew
Othryoneus
of
Kabesos,
a
sojourner
there,
who
but
lately
had
followed
after
the
rumour
of
war,
and
asked
in
marriage
the
fairest
of
the
daughters
of
Priam,
Kassandra,
without
gifts
of
wooing,
but
with
promise
of
a
mighty
deed,
namely
that
he
would
drive
perforce
out
of
Troy-land
the
sons
of
the
Achaians.
To
him
the
old
man
Priam
promised
and
appointed
that
he
would
give
her,
so
he
fought
trusting
in
his
promises.
And
Idomeneus
aimed
at
him
with
a
bright
spear,
and
cast
and
smote
him
as
he
came
proudly
striding
on,
and
the
corslet
of
bronze
that
he
wore
availed
not,
but
the
lance
stuck
in
the
midst
of
his
belly.
And
he
fell
with
a
crash,
and
Idomeneus
boasted
over
him,
and
lifted
up
his
voice,
saying
:
"
Othryoneus,
verily
I
praise
thee
above
all
mortal
men,
if
indeed
thou
shalt
accomplish
all
that
thou
hast
promised
to
Priam,
son
of
Dardanos,
that
pro-
mised
thee
again
his
own
daughter.
Yea,
and
we
likewise
would
promise
as
much
to
thee,
and
fulfil
it,
and
would
give
thee
the
fairest
daughter
of
the
son
of
Atreus,
and
bring
her
from
Argos,
and
wed
her
to
thee,
if
only
thou
wilt
aid
us
to
take
the
fair-set
citadel
of
Ilios.
Nay,
follow
us
that
we
may
make
a
covenant
of
marriage
by
the
seafaring
ships,
for
we
are
no
hard
exacters
of
gifts
of
wooing."
Therewith
the
hero
Idomeneus
dragged
him
by
the
foot
across
the
fierce
mellay.
But
Asios
came
to
his
aid,
on
foot
before
his
horses
that
the
charioteer
guided
so
that
still
their
breath
touched
the
shoulders
of
Asios.
And
the
desire
of
his
heart
was
to
cast
at
Idomeneus,
who
v.
beforehand
with
him,
and
smote
him
with
the
spear
in
the
throat,
below
the
chin,
and
drove
the
point
straight
through.
And
he
fell
as
an
oak
falls,
or
a
poplar,
or
tall
pine

that
craftsmen
have
felled
OR
the
hills
with
new
whetted
axes,
to
be
a
ship's
timber,
even
so
he
lay
stretched
out
before
the
horses
and
the
chariot,
groaning,
and
clutching
the
bloody
dust.
And
the
charioteer
was
amazed,
and
kept
not
his
wits,
as
of
old,
and
dared
not
turn
his
horses
and
avoid
out
of
the
hands
of
foemen
;
and
Antilochos
the
stead-
fast
in
war
smote
him,
and
pierced
the
middle
of
his
body
with
a
spear.
Nothing
availed
the
corslet
of
bronze
he
was
wont
to
wear,
but
he
planted
the
spear
fast
in
the
midst
of
his
belly.
Therewith
he
fell
gasping
from
the
well-wrought
chariot,
and
Antilochos,
the
son
of
great-hearted
Nestor,
drave
the
horses
out
from
the
Trojans,
among
the
well-
greaved
Achaians.
Then
Deiphobos,
in
sorrow
for
Asios,
drew
very
nigh
Idomeneus,
and
cast
at
him
with
his
shining
spear.
But
Idomeneus
steadily
watching
him,
avoided
the
spear
of
bronze,
being
hidden
beneath
the
circle
of
his
shield,
the
shield
covered
about
with
ox-hide
and
gleaming
bronze,
that
he
always
bore,
fitted
with
two
arm-rods
:
under
this
he
crouched
together,
and
the
spear
of
bronze
flew
over.
And
his
shield
rang
sharply,
as
the
spear
grazed
thereon.
Yet
it
flew
not
vainly
from
the
heavy
hand
of
Deiphobos,
but
smote
Hypsenor,
son
of
Hippasos,
the
shepherd
of
the
hosts,
in
the
liver,
beneath
the
midriff,
and
instantly
unstrung
his
knees.
And
Deiphobos
boasted
over
him
terribly,
cry-
ing
aloud
:
"
Ah,
verily,
not
unavenged
lies
Asios,
nay,
me-
thinks,
that
even
on
his
road
to
Hades,
strong
Warden
of
the
gate,
he
will
rejoice
at
heart,
since,
lo,
I
have
sent
him
escort
for
the
way
!
"
So
spake
he,
but
grief
came
on
the
Argives
by
reason
of
his
boast,
and
stirred
above
all
the
soul
of
the
wise-
hearted
Antilochos,
yet,
despite
his
sorrow,
he
was
not
heedless
of
his
dear
comrade,
but
ran
and
stood
over
him,
and
covered
him
with
his
buckler.
Then
two

panions,
Mekisteus,
son
of
Echios,
and
goodly
Alastor,
stooped
down
and
lifted
him,
and
with
heavy
groaning
bare
him
to
the
hollow
ships.
And
Idomeneus
relaxed
not
his
mighty
force,
but
ever
was
striving,
either
to
cover
some
one
of
the
Trojans
with
black
night,
or
himself
to
fall
in
warding
off
death
from
the
Achaians.
There
the
dear
son
of
Aisyetes,
fosterling
&lt;.t
Zeus,
even
the
hero
Alkathoos,
was
slain,
who
was
son-in-law
of
Anchises,
and
had
married
the
eldest
of
his
daughters,
Hippodameia,
whom
her
father
and
her
lady
mother
dearly
loved
in
the
halls,
for
she
excelled
all
the
maidens
of
her
age
in
beauty,
and
skill,
and
in
wisdom,
wherefore
the
best
man
in
wide
Troy
took
her
to
wife.
This
Alkathoos
did
Poseidon
subdue
to
Idomeneus,
throwing
a
spell
over
his
shining
eyes,
and
snaring
his
glorious
limbs
;
so
that
he
might
neither
flee
backwards,
nor
avoid
the
stroke,
but
stood
steady
as
a
pillar,
or
a
tree
with
lofty
crown
of
leaves,
when
the
hero
Idomeneus
smote
him
in
the
midst
of
the
breast
with
the
spear,
and
rent
the
coat
of
bronze
about
him,
that
aforetime
warded
death
from
his
body,
but
now
rang
harsh
as
it
was
rent
by
the
spear.
And
he
fell
with
a
crash,
and
the
lance
fixed
in
his
heart,
that,
still
beating,
shook
the
butt-end
of
the
spear.
Then
at
length
mighty
Ares
spent
its
fury
there
;
but
Idomeneus
boasted
terribly,
and
cried
aloud
:
"
Deiphobos,
are
we
to
deem
it
fair
acquittal
that
we
have
slain
three
men
for
one,
since
thou
boastest
thus
?
Nay,
sir,
but
stand
thou
up
also
thyself
against
me,
that
thou
mayst
know
what
manner
of
son
of
Zeus
am
I
that
have
come
hither
!
For
Zeus
first
begat
Minos,
the
warden
of
Crete,
and
Minos
got
him
a
son,
the
noble
Deukalion,
and
Deukalion
begat
me,
a
prince
over
many
men
in
wide
Crete,
and
now
have
the
ships
brought
me
hither,
a
bane
to
thee
and
thy
father,
and
all
the
Trojans."
260
ILIAD
XIII,
455-484-
Thus
he
spake,
but
the
thoughts
of
Deiphobos
were
divided,
whether
he
should
retreat,
and
call
to
his
aid
some
one
of
the
great-hearted
Trojans,
or
should
try
the
adventure
alone.
And
on
this
wise
to
his
mind
it
seemed
the
better,
to
go
after
Aineias.
whom
he
found
standing
the
last
in
the
press,
for
Aineias
was
ever
wroth
against
goodly
Priam,
for
that
Priam
gave
him
no
honour,
despite
his
valour
among
men.
So
Deiphobos
stood
by
him,
and
spake
winged
words
to
him
:
"
Aineias,
thou
counsellor
of
the
Trojans,
now
verily
there
is
great
need
that
thou
shouldst
succour
thy
sister's
husband,
if
any
care
for
kin
doth
touch
thee.
Nay
follow,
let
us
succour
Alkathoos,
thy
sister's
husband,
who
of
old
did
cherish
thee
in
his
hall,
while
thou
wert
but
a
little
one,
and
now,
lo,
spear
-famed
Idomeneus
hath
stripped
him
of
his
arms
!
"
So
he
spake,
and
roused
the
spirit
in
the
breast
of
Aineias,
who
went
to
seek
Idomeneus,
with
high
thoughts
of
war.
But
fear
took
not
hold
upon
Idomeneus,
as
though
he
had
been
some
tender
boy,
but
he
stood
at
bay,
like
a
boar
on
the
hills
that
trusteth
to
his
strength,
and
abides
the
great
assailing
throng
of
men
in
a
lonely
place,
and
he
bristles
up
his
back,
and
his
eyes
shine
with
fire,
while
he
whets
his
tusks,
and
is
right
eager
to
keep
at
bay
both
men
and
hounds.
Even
so
stood
spear
-famed
Idomeneus
at
bay
against
Aineias,
that
came
to
the
rescue,
and
gave
ground
no
whit,
but
called
on
his
comrades,
glancing
to
Askalaphos,
and
Aphareus,
and
Deipyros,
and
Meriones,
and
Antilochos,
all
masters
of
the
war-cry
;
them
he
spurred
up
to
battle,
and
spake
winged
words
:
"
Hither,
friends,
and
rescue
me,
all
alone
as
I
am,
and
terribly
I
dread
the
onslaught
of
swift-
footed
Aineias,
that
is
assailing
me
;
for
he
is
right
strong
to
destroy
men
in
battle,
and
he
hath
the
flower
of
youth,
the
greatest
avail
that
may
be.
Yea,
if
he
and
I
were

age,
and
in
this
spirit
whereof
now
we
arc,
speedily
should
he
or
I
achieve
high
victory."
So
he
spake,
and
they
all,
being
of
one
spirit
in
their
hearts,
stood
hard
by
each
other,
with
buckler
laid
on
shoulder.
But
Aineias,
on
the
other
side,
cried
to
hi-.
comrades,
glancing
to
Deiphobos,
and
Paris,
and
noble
Agenor,
that
with
him
were
leaders
of
the
Trojans
;
and
then
the
hosts
followed
them,
as
sheep
follow
their
leader
to
the
water
from
the
pasture,
and
the
shepherd
is
glad
at
heart;
even
so
the
heart
of
Aineias
was
glad
in
his
breast,
when
he
saw
the
hosts
of
the
people
following
to
aid
him.
Then
they
rushed
in
close
fight
around
Alkathoos
with
their
long
spears,
and
round
their
breasts
the
bronze
rang
terribly,
as
they
aimed
at
each
other
in
the
press,
while
two
men
of
war
beyond
the
rest,
Aineias
and
Idomeneus,
the
peers
of
Ares,
were
each
striving
to
hew
the
flesh
of
the
other
with
the
pitiless
bronze.
Now
Aineias
first
cast
at
Idomeneus,
who
steadily
watching
him
avoided
the
spear
of
bronze,
and
the
point
of
Aineias
went
quivering
in
the
earth,
since
vainly
it
had
flown
from
his
stalwart
hand.
But
Idomeneus
smote
Oinomaos
in
the
midst
of
the
belly,
and
brake
the
plate
of
his
corslet,
and
the
bronze
let
forth
the
bowels
through
the
corslet,
and
he
fell
in
the
dust
and
clutched
the
earth
in
his
palms.
And
Idomeneus
drew
forth
the
far-shadowing
spear
from
the
dead,
but
could
noi
avail
to
strip
the
rest
of
the
fair
armour
from
his
shoulders,
for
the
darts
pressed
hard
on
him
Nay,
and
his
feet
nc
longer
served
him
firmly
in
a
charge,
nor
could
he
rush
after
his
own
spear,
nor
avoid
the
foe.
Wherefore
in
close
fight
he
still
held
off
the
pitiless
day
of
destiny,
but
in
retreat
his
feet
no
longer
bore
him
swiftly
from
the
battle.
And
as
he
was
slowly
departing,
Deiphobos
aimed
at
him
with
his
shining
spear,
for,
verily
he
ever
cherished
a

hatred
against
Idomeneus.
But
this
time,
too,
he
missed
him,
and
smote
Askalaphos,
the
son
of
Enyalios,
with
his
dart,
and
the
strong
spear
passed
through
his
shoulder,
and
he
fell
in
the
dust,
and
clutched
the
earth
in
his
out-
stretched
hand.
But
loud-voiced
awful
Ares
was
not
yet
aware
at
all
that
his
son
had
fallen
in
strong
battle,
but
he
was
reclining
on
the
peak
of
Olympus,
beneath
the
golden
clouds,
being
held
there
by
the
design
of
Zeus,
where
also
were
the
other
deathless
gods,
restrained
from
the
war.
Now
the
people
rushed
in
close
fight
around
Askalaphos,
and
Deiphobos
tore
from
Askalaphos
his
shining
helm,
but
Meriones,
the
peer
of
swift
Ares,
leaped
forward
and
smote
the
arm
of
Deiphobos
with
his
spear,
and
from
his
hand
the
vizored
casque
fell
clanging
to
the
ground.
And
Meriones
sprang
forth
instantly,
like
a
vulture,
and
drew
the
strong
spear
from
the
shoulder
of
Deiphobos,
and
fell
back
among
the
throng
of
his
comrades.
But
the
own
brother
of
Deiphobos,
Polites,
stretched
his
hands
round
his
waist,
and
led
him
forth
from
the
evil
din
of
war,
even
till
he
came
to
the
swift
horses,
that
waited
for
him
behind
the
battle
and
the
fight,
with
their
charioteer,
and
well-dight
chariot.
These
bore
him
heavily
groaning
to
the
city,
worn
with
his
hurt,
and
the
blood
ran
down
from
his
newly
wounded
arm.
But
the
rest
still
were
fighting,
and
the
war-cry
rose
unquenched.
There
Aineias
rushed
on
Aphareus,
son
of
Kaletor,
and
struck
his
throat,
that
chanced
to
be
turned
to
him,
with
the
keen
spear,
and
his
head
dropped
down
and
his
shield
and
helm
fell
with
him,
and
death
that
slays
the
spirit
overwhelmed
him.
And
Antilochos
watched
Thoon
as
he
turned
the
other
way,
and
leaped
on
him,
and
wounded
him,
severing
all
the
vein
that
runs
up
the
back
till
it
reaches
the
neck
;
this
he
severed
clean,
and
Thoon
fell
on
his
back
in
the
dust,
stretching
out
both
his
hands
to

comrades
dear.
Then
Antilochos
rushed
on,
and
strip
the
armour
from
his
shoulders,
glancing
around
while
the
Trojans
gathered
from
here
and
there,
and
smote
his
wide
shining
shield,
yet
did
not
avail
to
graze,
behind
the
shield.
the
delicate
flesh
of
Antilochos
with
the
pitiless
bronze.
For
verily
Poseidon,
the
Shaker
of
the
earth,
did
guard
on
every
side
the
son
of
Nestor,
even
in
the
midst
of
the
javelins.
And
never
did
Antilochos
get
free
of
the
foe,
but
turned
him
about
among
them,
nor
ever
was
his
spear
at
rest,
but
always
brandished
and
shaken,
and
the
aim
of
his
heart
was
to
smite
a
foeman
from
afar,
or
to
set
on
him
at
close
quar-
ters.
But
as
he
was
aiming
through
the
crowd,
he
escaped
not
the
ken
of
Adamas,
son
of
Asios,
who
smote
the
midst
of
his
shield
with
the
sharp
bronze,
setting
on
nigh
at
hand
;
but
Poseidon
of
the
dark
locks
made
his
shaft
of
no
avail,
grudging
him
the
life
of
Antilochos.
And
part
of
the
spear
abode
there,
like
a
burned
stake,
in
the
shield
of
Antilochos,
and
half
lay
on
the
earth,
and
back
retreated
Adamas
to
the
ranks
of
his
comrades,
avoiding
Fate.
But

with

between

parts
and
the

wound

most
baneful
to

mortals.
Even
there
he
fixed
the
spear
in
him
and
he
fell,
and
writhed
about
the
spear,
even
as

And
darkness
covered

And
Helenos

Then
grief
took
hold
of
the
son
of
Atreus,
Menelaos
of
the
loud
war-cry,
and
he
went
with
a
threat
against
the
warrior
Helenos,
the
prince,
shaking
his
sharp
spear,
while
the
other
drew
the
centre-piece
of
his
bow.
And
both
at
once
were
making
ready
to
let
fly,
one
with
his
sharp
spear,
the
other
with
the
arrow
from
the
string.
Then
the
son
of
Priam
smote
Menelaos
on
the
breast
with
his
arrow,
on
the
plate
of
the
corslet,
and
off
flew
the
bitter
arrow.
Even
as
from
a
broad
shovel
in
a
great
threshing
floor,
fly
the
black-skinned
beans
and
pulse,
before
the
whistling
wind,
and
the
stress
of
the
winnower's
shovel,
even
so
from
the
corslet
of
renowned
Menelaos
flew
glancing
far
aside
the
bitter
arrow.
But
the
son
of
Atreus,
Menelaos
of
the
loud
war-cry,
smote
the
hand
of
Helenos
wherein
he
held
the
polished
bow,
and
into
the
bow,
clean
through
the
hand,
was
driven
the
spear
of
bronze.
Back
he
withdrew
to
the
ranks
of
his
comrades,
avoiding
Fate,
with
his
hand
hanging
down
at
his
side,
for
the
ashen
spear
dragged
after
him.
And
the
great-hearted
Agenor
drew
the
spear
from
his
hand,
and
himself
bound
up
the
hand
with
a
band
of
twisted
sheep's-wool,
a
sling
that
a
squire
carried
for
him,
the
shepherd
of
the
host.
Then
Peisandros
made
straight
for
renowned
Menelaos,
but
an
evil
Fate
was
leading
him
to
the
end
of
Death
;
by
thee,
Menelaos,
to
be
overcome
in
the
dread
strife
of
battle.
Now
when
the
twain
had
come
nigh
in
onset
upon
each
other,
the
son
of
Atreus
missed,
and
his
spear
was
turned
aside,
but
Peisandros
smote
the
shield
of
renowned
Menelaos,
yet
availed
not
to
drive
the
bronze
clean
through,
for
the
wide
shield
caught
it,
and
the
spear
brake
in
the
socket,
yet
Peisandros
rejoiced
in
his
heart,
and
hoped
for
the
victory.
But
the
son
of
Atreus
drew
his
silver-studded
sword,
and
leaped
upon
Peisandros.
And
Peisandros,
under
his
shield,
clutched
his
goodly
axe
of
fine
bronze,
with
long

polished
haft
of
olive-wood,
and
the
twain
set
upon
each
other.
Then
Peisandros
smote
the
crest
of
the
helmet
shaded
with
horse
hair,
close
below
the
very
plume,
but
Menelaos
struck
the
other,
as
he
came
forward,
on
the
brow,
above
the
base
of
the
nose,
and
the
bones
cracked,
and
the
eyes,
all
bloody,
fell
at
his
feet
in
the
dust.
Then
he
bowed
and
fell,
and
Menelaos
set
his
foot
on
his
breast,
and
stripped
him
of
his
arms,
and
triumphed,
saying
:
"
Even
thus
then
surely,
ye
will
leave
the
ships
of
the
Danaans
of
the
swift
steeds,
ye
Trojans
overweening,
insatiate
of
the
dread
din
of
war.
Yea,
and
ye
shall
not
lack
all
other
reproof
and
shame,
wherewith
ye
made
me
ashamed,
ye
hounds
of
evil,
having
no
fear
in
your
hearts
of
the
strong
wrath
of
loud-
thundering
Zeus,
the
god
of
guest
and
host,
who
one
day
will
destroy
your
steep
citadel.
O
ye
that
wantonly
carried
away
my
wedded
wife
and
many
of
my
possessions,
when
ye
were
entertained
by
her,
now
again
ye
are
fain
to
throw
ruinous
fire
on
the
seafaring
ships,
and
to
slay
the
Achaian
heroes.
Nay,
but
ye
will
yet
refrain
you
from
battle,
for
as
eager
as
ye
be.
O
father
Zeus,
verily
they
say
that
thou
dost
excel
in
wisdom
all
others,
both
gods
and
men,
and
all
these
things
are
from
thee.
How
wondrously
art
thou
favouring
men
of
violence,
even
the
Trojans,
whose
might
is
ever
iniquitous,
nor
can
they
have
their
fill
of
the
din
of
equal
war.
Of
all
things
there
is
satiety,
yea,
even
of
love
and
sleep,
and
of
sweet
song,
and
dance
delectable,
whereof
a
man
would
sooner
have
his
fill
than
of
war,
but
the
Trojans
are
insatiable
of
battle."
Thus
noble
Menelaos
spake,
and
stripped
the
bloody
arms
from
the
body,
and
gave
them
to
his
comrades,
and
instantly
himself
went
forth
again,
and
mingled
in
the
fore-
front
of
the
battle.
Then
Harpalion,
the
son
of
king
Pylaimenes,
leaped
out
against
him,

his
dear
father
to
Troy,
to
the
war,
nor
ever
came
again
to
his
own
country.
He
then
smote
the
middle
of
the
shield
of
Atreus'
son
with
his
spear,
in
close
fight,
yet
availed
not
to
drive
the
bronze
clean
through,
but
fell
back
into
the
host
of
his
comrades,
avoiding
Fate,
glancing
round
every
way,
lest
one
should
wound
his
flesh
with
the
bronze.
But
Meriones
shot
at
him
as
he
retreated
with
a
bronze-shod
arrow,
and
smote
him
in
the
right
buttock,
and
the
arrow
went
right
through
the
bladder
and
came
out
under
the
bone.
And
sitting
down,
even
there,
in
the
arms
of
his
dear
comrades,
he
breathed
away
his
soul,
lying
stretched
like
a
worm
on
the
earth,
and
out
flowed
the
black
blood,
and
wetted
the
ground.
And
the
Paphlagonians
great
of
heart,
tended
him
busily,
and
set
him
in
a
chariot,
and
drove
him
to
sacred
Ilios
sorrowing,
and
with
them
went
his
father,
shedding
tears,
and
there
was
no
atonement
for
his
dead
son.
Now
Paris
was
very
wroth
at
heart
by
reason
of
his
slay-
ing,
for
he
had
been
his
host
among
the
many
Paphlagonians,
wherefore,
in
wrath
for
his
sake,
he
let
fly
a
bronze-shod
arrow.
Now
there
was
a
certain
Euchenor,
the
son
of
Polyidos
the
seer,
a
rich
man
and
a
good,
whose
dwelling
was
in
Corinth.
And
well
he
knew
his
own
ruinous
fate,
when
he
went
on
ship-board,
for
often
would
the
old
man,
the
good
Polyidos,
tell
him,
that
he
must
either
perish
of
a
sore
disease
in
his
halls,
or
go
with
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
and
be
overcome
by
the
Trojans.
Wherefore
he
avoided
at
once
the
heavy
war-fine
of
the
Achaians,
and
the
hateful
disease,
that
so
he
might
not
know
any
anguish.
This
man
did
Paris
smite
beneath
the
jaw
and
under
the
ear,
and
swiftly
his
spirit
departed
from
his
limbs,
and,
lo,
dread
dark-
ness
overshadowed
him.
So
they
fought
like
flaming
fire,
but
Hector,
beloved

ILIAD

674-706.
267
Zeus,
had
not
heard
nor
knew
at
all
that,
on
the
left
of
the
ships,
his
host
was
being
subdued
by
the
Argives,
and
soon
would
the
Achaians
have
won
renown,
so
mighty
was
the
Holder
and
Shaker
of
the
earth
that
urged
on
the
Argives
\
yea,
and
himself
mightily
defended
them.
But
Hector
kept
where
at
first
he
had
leaped
within
the
walls
and
the
gate,
and
broken
the
serried
ranks
of
shield-bearing
Danaans,
ever
where
were
the
ships
of
Aias
and
Protesilaos,
drawn
up
on
the
beach
of
the
hoary
sea,
while
above
the
wall
was
builded
lowest,
and
thereby
chiefly
the
heroes
and
their
horses
were
raging
in
battle.
There
the
Boiotians,
and
lonians
with
trailing
tunics,
and
Lokrians
and
Phthians
and
illustrious
Epeians
scarcely
availed
to
stay
his
onslaught
on
the
ships,
nor
yet
could
they
drive
back
from
them
noble
Hector,
like
a
flame
of
fire.
And
there
were
the
picked
men
of
the
Athenians
;
among
them
Menestheus
son
of
Peteos
was
the
leader
;
and
there
followed
with
him
Pheidas
and
Stichios,
and
brave
Bias,
while
the
Epeians
were
led
by
Meges,
son
of
Phyleus,
and
Amphion
and
Drakios,
and
in
front
of
the
Phthians
were
Medon,
and
Podarkes
resolute
in
war.
Now
the
one,
Medon,
was
the
bastard
son
of
noble
Oileus,
and
brother
of
Aias,
and
he
dwelt
in
Phylake,
far
from
his
own
country,
for
that
he
had
slain
a
man,
the
brother
of
his
stepmother
Eriopis,
wife
of
Oileus.
But
the
other,
Podarkes,
was
the
son
of
Iphiklos
son
of
Phylakos,
and
they
in
their
armour,
in
the
van
of
the
great-hearted
Phthians,
were
detVndin-
the
ships,
and
fighting
among
the
Boiotians.
Now
never
at
all
did
Aias,
the
swift
son
of
Oileus,
clepait
from
the
side
of
Aias,
son
of
Telamon,
nay,
not
for
an
instant,
but
even
as
in

wine-dark
oxen

the

and

them
but
the
polished
yoke,
as
they
labour
through
the
furrow,
till
the
end
of
the
furrow
brings
them
up,
so
stood
the
two
Aiantes
close
by
each
other.
Now
verily
did
many
and
noble
hosts
of
his
comrades
follow
with
the
son
of
Telamon,
and
bore
his
shield
when
labour
and
sweat
came
upon
his
limbs.
But
the
Lokrians
followed
not
with
the
high-hearted
son
of
Oileus,
for
their
hearts
were
not
stead-
fast
in
close
brunt
of
battle,
seeing
that
they
had
no
helmets
of
bronze,
shadowy
with
horse
-hair
plumes,
nor
round
shields,
nor
ashen
spears,
but
trusting
in
bows
and
well-
twisted
slings
of
sheep's
wool,
they
followed
with
him
to
Ilios.
Therewith,
in
the
war,
they
shot
thick
and
fast,
and
brake
the
ranks
of
the
Trojans.
So
the
one
party
in
front,
with
their
well
-
dight
arms
contended
with
the
Trojans,
and
with
Hector
arrayed
in
bronze,
while
the
others
from
behind
kept
shooting
from
their
ambush,
and
the
Trojans
lost
all
memory
of
the
joy
of
battle,
for
the
arrows
confounded
them.
There
then
right
ruefully
from
the
ships
and
the
huts
would
the
Trojans
have
withdrawn
to
windy
Ilios,
had
not
Polydamas
come
near
valiant
Hector
and
said
:
"
Hector,
thou
art
hard
to
be
persuaded
by
them
that
would
counsel
thee
;
for
that
god
has
given
thee
excellence
in
the
works
of
war,
therefore
in
council
also
thou
art
fain
to
excel
other
men
in
knowledge.
But
in
nowise
wilt
thou
be
able
to
take
everything
on
thyself.
For
to
one
man
has
god
given
for
his
portion
the
works
of
war,
[to
another
the
dance,
to
another
the
lute
and
song,]
but
in
the
heart
of
yet
another
hath
far-seeing
Zeus
placed
an
excellent
under-
standing,
whereof
many
men
get
gain,
yea
he
saveth
many
an
one,
and
himself
best
knoweth
it.
But,
lo,
I
will
speak
even
as
it
seemeth
best
to
me.
Behold
all
about
thee
the
circle
of
war
is
blazing,
but
the
great-hearted
Trojans,

that
they
have
got
down
the
wall,
are
some
with
their
arms
standing
aloof
and
some
are
fighting,
few
men
against
a
host,
being
scattered
among
the
ships.
Nay,
withdraw
thee,
and
call
hither
all
the
best
of
the
warriors.
Thereafter
shall
we
take
all
counsel
carefully,
whether
we
should
fall
on
the
ships
of
many
benches,
if
indeed
god
willeth
to
give
us
victory,
or
after
counsel
held,
should
return
unharmed
from
the
ships.
For
verily
I
fear
lest
the
Achaians
repay
their
del&gt;t
of
yesterday,
since
by
the
ships
there
tarrieth
a
man
insatiate
of
war,
and
never,
methinks,
will
he
wholly
stand
aloof
from
battle."
So
spake
Polydamas,
and
his
safe
counsel
pleased
Hector
well,
who
[straightway
sprang
to
earth
from
the
chariot
with
his
arms,
and]
spake
to
him
winged
words
and
said
:
i'oly-
damas,
do
thou
stay
here
all
the
best
of
the
host,
but
I
will
go
thither
to
face
the
war,
and
swiftly
will
return
again,
when
I
have
straitly
laid
on
them
my
commands."
So
he
spake,
and
set
forth,
in
semblance
like
a
snowy
mountain,
and
shouting
aloud
he
flew
through
the
Trojans
and
allies.
And
they
all
sped
to
Polydamas,
the
kindly
son
of
Panthoos,
when
they
heard
the
voice
of
Hector.
But
he
went
seeking
Deiphobos,
and
the
strong
prince
Helenos,
and
Adamas
son
of
Asios,
and
Asios
son
of
Hyr-
takos,
among
the
warriors
in
the
foremost
line,
if
anywhere
he
might
find
them.
But
them
he
found
not
at
all
un-
harmed,
nor
free
of
bane,
but,
lo,
some
among
the
sterns
of
the
ships
of
the
Achaians
lay
lifeless,
slain
by
the
hands
of
the
Argives,
and
some
were
within
the
wall
wounded
by
thrust
or
cast.
But
one
he
readily
found,
on
the
left
of
the
dolorous
battle,
goodly
Alexandros,
the
lord
of
fair-tressed
Helen,
heartening
his
comrades
and
speeding
them
to
war
\
\
he
drew
near
to
him,
and
addressed
him
with
won
"

fairest
of
face,

thou
seducer,
where,
prithee,
are
Deiphobos,
and
the
strong
prince
Helenos,
and
Adamas
son
of
Asios,
and
Asios
son
of
Hyrtakos,
and
where
is
Othryoneus
?
Now
hath
all
high
Ilios
perished
utterly.
Now,
too,
thou
seest,
is
sheer
destruc-
tion
sure."
Then
godlike
Alexandros
answered
him
again
saying
:
"Hector,
since
thy
mind
is
to
blame
one
that
is
blame-
less,
some
other
day
might
I
rather
withdraw
me
from
the
war,
since
my
mother
bare
not
even
me
wholly
a
coward.
For
from
the
time
that
thou
didst
gather
the
battle
of
thy
comrades
about
the
ships,
from
that
hour
do
we
abide
here,
and
war
with
the
Danaans
ceaselessly;
and
our
comrades
concerning
whom
thou
inquirest
are
slain.
Only
Deiphobos
and
the
strong
prince
Helenos
have
both
withdrawn,
both
of
them
being
wounded
in
the
hand
with
long
spears,
for
Kronion
kept
death
away
from
them.
But
now
lead
on,
wheresoever
thy
heart
and
spirit
bid
thee,
and
we
will
follow
with
thee
eagerly,
nor
methinks
shall
we
lack
for
valour,
as
far
as
we
have
strength
;
but
beyond
his
strength
may
no
man
fight,
howsoever
eager
he
be."
So
spake
the
hero,
and
persuaded
his
brother's
heart,
and
they
went
forth
where
the
war
and
din
were
thickest,
round
Kebriones,
and
noble
Polydamas,
and
Phalkes,
and
Orthaios,
and
godlike
Polyphetes,
and
Palmys,
and
Askanios,
and
Morys,
son
of
Hippotion,
who
had
come
in
their
turn,
out
of
deep
-soiled
Askanie,
on
the
morn
before,
and
now
Zeus
urged
them
to
fight.
And
these
set
forth
like
the
blast
of
violent
winds,
that
rushes
earthward
beneath
the
thunder
of
father
Zeus,
and
with
marvellous
din
doth
mingle
with
the
salt
sea,
and
therein
are
many
swelling
waves
of
the
loud
roaring
sea,
arched
over
and
white
with
foam,
some
van-
ward,
others
in
the
rear
;
even
so
the
Trojans
arrayed
in
van
and
rear
and
shining
with
bronze,
followed
after
their
leaders.

And
Hector
son
of

was
leading
them,

of

In
front
he
held

and

on

he
charged

But
he
could
not
confound
the
In-art
within
the
breast
of
the
Achaians.
And
Aias,
stalking
with
long
strides,
challenged
him
first
:
"Sir,
draw
nigh,
wherefore
dost
thou
vainly

dismay

Argives?

are
in
no
wise

of

but
by
the
cruel
scourge
of
Zeus

Surely
now
thy
heart
hopes
utterly
to
spoil
the
ships,
but
we
too
have
hands
presently
to
hold
our
own.
Verily
your
peopled
city
will
long
ere
that
beneath
our
hands
be
taken
and
sacked.
But
for
thee,
I
tell
thee
that
the
time
is
at
hand,
when
thou
shalt
pray
in
thy
flight
to
father
Zeus,
and
the
other
immortal
gods,
that
thy
fair-maned
st-
may
be
fleeter
than
falcons
:
thy
steeds
that
are
to
bear
t
to
the
city,
as
they
storm
in
dust
across
the
plain."
And
even
as
he
spake,
a
bird
flew
forth
on
the
right
hand,
an
eagle
of
lofty
flight,
and
the
host
of
the
Achaians
shouted
thereat,
encouraged
by
the
omen,
but

Hector
answered
:
"

that

that

that

and

was

YET
the
cry
of
battle
escaped
not
Nestor,
albeit
at
his
wine,
but
he
spake
winged
words
to
the
son
of
Asklepios
:
u
I'.e-
think
thee,
noble
Machaon,
what
had
best
be
done;
lo,
louder
waxes
the
cry
of
the
strong
warriors
by
the
ships.
Nay,
now
sit
where
thou
art,
and
drink

Hekamede

Therewith
he
took
the
well-
wrought
shield
of
his
son,
horse-
taming
Thrasymedes,
which
was
lying
in
the
hut,
all
glistering
with
bronze,
for
the
son
had
the
shield
of
his
father.
And
he
seized
a
strong
spear,
with
a
point
of
keen
bronze,
and
stood
outside
the
hut,
and
straightway
beheld
a
deed
of
shame,
the
Achaians
fleeing
in
rout,
and
the

Trojans

and

or
go
after
Agamemnon,
son
of
Atreus,
shepherd
of
the
host.
And
thus
as
he
pondered,
it
seemed
to
him
the
better
counsel
to
go
to
the
son
of
Atreus.
Meanwhile
they
were
warring
and
slaying
each
other,
and
the
stout
bronze
rang
about
their
bodies
as
they
were
thrust
with
swords
and
double-pointed
spears.
Now
the
kings,
the
fosterlings
of
Zeus,
encountered
Nestor,
as
they
went
up
from
the
ships,
even
they
that
were
wounded
with
the
bronze,
Tydeus'
son,
and
Odys-
seus,
and
Agamemnon,
son
of
Atreus.
For
far
apart
from
the
battle
were
their
ships
drawn
up,
on
the
shore
of
the
grey
sea,
for
these
were
the
first
they
had
drawn
up
to
the
plain,
but
had
builded
the
wall
in
front
of
the
hindmost.
For
in
no
wise
might
the
beach,
for
as
wide
as
it
was,
hold
all
the
ships,
and
the
host
was
straitened.
Wherefore
they
drew
up
the
ships
row
within
row,
and
filled
up
the
wide
mouth
of
all
the
shore
that
the
headlands
held
between
them.
Therefore
the
kings
were
going
together,
leaning
on
their
spears,
to
look
on
the
war
and
fray,
and
the
heart
of
each
was
sore
within
his
breast.
And
the
old
man
met
them,
even
Nestor,
and
caused
the
spirit
to
fail
within
the
breasts
of
the
Achaians.
And
mighty
Agamemnon
spake
and
accosted
him
:
"
O
Nestor,
son
of
Neleus,
great
glory
of
the
Achaians,
where-
fore
dost
thou
come
hither
and
hast
deserted
the
war,
the
bane
of
men
?
Lo,
I
fear
the
accomplishment
of
the
word
that
dread
Hector
spake,
and
the
threat
wherewith
he
threatened
us,
speaking
in
the
assembly
of
the
Trojans,
namely,
that
never
would
he
return
to
Ilios
from
the
ships,
till
he
had
burned
the
ships
with
fire,
and
slain
the
men.
Even
so
he
spake,
and,
lo,
now
all
these
things
are
being
fulfilled.
Alas,
surely
even
the
other
well-greaved
Achaians
store
wrath
against
me
in
their
hearts,
like
Achilles,
and
have
no
desire
to
fight
by
the
rearmost
ships."
ILIAD
XIV,
52-81.
Then
Nestor
of
Gerenia
the
knight
answered
him
say
ing:
"Verily
these
things
are
now
at
hand,
and
bei
accomplished,
nor
otherwise
could
Zeus
himself
contri\c
them,
he
that
thundereth
on
high.
For,
lo,
the
wall
is
overthrown,
wherein
we
trusted
that
it
should
be
an
un-
broken
bulwark
of
the
ships
and
of
our
own
bodies.
And
these
men
by
the
swift
ships
have
endless
battle
without
sparing,
and
no
more
couldst
thou
tell,
howsoever
closely
thou
mightst
spy,
from
what
side
the
Achaians
are
drr
in
rout,
so
confusedly
are
they
slain,
and
the
cry
of
battle
goeth
up
to
heaven.
But
let
us
take
counsel,
how
these
things
may
best
be
done,
if
wit
may
do
aught
:
but
into
the
war
I
counsel
not
that
we
should
go
down,
for
in
no
wise
may
a
wounded
man
do
battle."
Then
Agamemnon
king
of
men
answered
him
again
:
"Nestor,
for
that
they
are
warring
by
the
rearmost
ships,
and
the
well-builded
wall
hath
availed
not,
nor
the
trench,
whereat
the
Achaians
endured
so
much
labour,
hoping
in
their
hearts
that
it
should
be
the
unbroken
bulwark
of
the
ships,
and
of
their
own
bodies
—
such
it
seemeth
must
be
the
will
of
Zeus
supreme,
[that
the
Achaians
should
perish
here
nameless
far
from
Argos].
For
I
knew
it
when
he
was
forward
to
aid
the
Danaans,
and
now
I
know
that
he
is
giving
to
the
Trojans
glory
like
that
of
the
blessed
gods,
and
hath
bound
our
hands
and
our
strength.
But
come,
as
I
declare,
let
us
all
obey.
Let
us
drag
down
the
ships
that
are
drawn
up
in
the
first
line
near
to
the
sea,
and
speed
them
all
forth
to
the
salt
sea
divine,
and
moor
them
far
out
with
stones,
till
the
divine
night
comes,
if
even
at
night
the
:
jans
will
refrain
from
war,
and
then
might
we
drag
dour,
all
the
ships.
For
there
is
no
shame
in
fleein-
from
rum,
yea,
even
in
the
night.
Better
doth
he
fate
who
flcc.s
i:
trouble,
than
he
that
is
overtaken."
276
ILIAD
XIV,
82-112.
Then,
looking
on
him
sternly,
spake
Odysseus
of
many
counsels
:
"
Atreus'
son,
what
word
hath
passed
the
door
of
thy
lips
?
Man
of
mischief,
sure
thou
shouldst
lead
some
other
inglorious
army,
not
be
king
among
us,
to
whom
Zeus
hath
given
it,
from
youth
even
unto
age,
to
wind
the
skein
of
grievous
wars,
till
every
man
of
us
perish.
Art
thou
indeed
so
eager
to
leave
the
wide-wayed
city
of
the
Trojans,
the
city
for
which
we
endure
with
sorrow
so
many
evils
?
Be
silent,
lest
some
other
of
the
Achaians
hear
this
word,
that
no
man
should
so
much
as
suffer
to
pass
through
his
mouth,
none
that
understandeth
in
his
heart
how
to
speak
fit
counsel,
none
that
is
a
sceptred
king,
and
hath
hosts
obeying
him
so
many
as
the
Argives
over
whom
thou
reignest.
And
now
I
wholly
scorn
thy
thoughts,
such
a
word
as
thou
hast
uttered,
thou
that,
in
the
midst
of
war
and
battle,
dost
bid
us
draw
down
the
well-timbered
ships
to
the
sea,
that
even
more
than
ever
the
Trojans
may
possess
their
desire,
albeit
they
win
the
mastery
even
now,
and
sheer
destruction
fall
upon
us.
For
the
Achaians
will
not
make
good
the
war,
when
the
ships
are
drawn
down
to
the
salt
sea,
but
will
look
round
about
to
flee,
and
withdraw
from
battle.
There
will
thy
counsel
work
a
mischief,
O
marshal
of
the
host
!"
Then
the
king
of
men,
Agamemnon,
answered
him
;
"Odysseus,
right
sharply
hast
thou
touched
my
heart
with
thy
stern
reproof
:
nay,
I
do
not
bid
the
sons
of
the
Achaians
to
drag,
against
their
will,
the
well-timbered
ships
to
the
salt
sea.
Now
perchance
there
may
be
one
who
will
utter
a
wiser
counsel
than
this
of
mine,
—
a
young
man
or
an
old,
—
wel-
come
would
it
be
to
me."
Then
Diomedes
of
the
loud
war-cry
spake
also
among
them
:
"
The
man

not

Let
us

then
might

So
he
spake,
and
they
all
heard
him
readily,
and
ol&gt;&lt;
him.
And
they
set
forth,
led
by
Agamemnon
the
king
of
men.

went
with

in

of

and
the

of

Atreus'
son,
and
utu-
winged
words
he
spake
to

saying
:

with

and

from

ships
and
the

So
spake
he,
and
shouted
mightily,
as
he
sped
over
the
plain.
And
loud
as
nine
thousand
men,
or
ten
thousand
cry
in
battle,
when
they
join
the
strife
of
war,
so
mighty
was
the
cry
that
the
strong
Shaker
of
the
earth
sent
forth
from
his
breast,
and
great
strength
he
put
into
the
heart
of
each
of
the
Achaians,
to
strive
and
war
unceasingly.
Now
Hera
of
the
golden
throne
stood
on
the
peak
of
Olympus,
and
saw
with
her
eyes,
and
anon
knew
him
that
was
her
brother
and
her
lord's
going
to
and
fro
through
the
glorious
fight,
and
she
rejoiced
in
her
heart.
And
she
beheld
Zeus
sitting
on
the
topmost
crest
of
many-
fountained
Ida,
and
to
her
heart
he
was
hateful.
Then
she
took
thought,
the
ox-eyed
lady
Hera,
how
she
might
beguile
the
mind
of
aegis-bearing
Zeus.
And
this
seemed
to
her
in
her
heart
to
be
the
best
counsel,
namely
to
fare
to
Ida,
when
she
had
well
adorned
herself,
if
perchance
he
would
desire
to
sleep
beside
her
and
embrace
her
body
in
love,
and
a
sweet
sleep
and
a
kindly
she
could
pour
on
his
eyelids
and
his
crafty
wits.
And
she
set
forth
to
her
bower,
that
her
dear
son
Hephaistos
had
fashioned,
and
therein
had
made
fast
strong
doors
on
the
pillars,
with
a
secret
bolt,
that
no
other
god
might
open.
There
did
she
enter
in
and
closed
the
shin-
ing
doors.
With
ambrosia
first
did
she
cleanse
every
stain
from
her
winsome
body,
and
anointed
her
with
olive
oil,
ambrosial,
soft,
and
of
a
sweet
savour
;
if
it
were
but
shaken,
in
the
bronze-floored
mansion
of
Zeus,
the
savour
thereof
went
right
forth
to
earth
and
heaven.
Therewith
she
anointed
her
fair
body,
and
combed
her
hair,
and
with
her
hands
plaited
her
shining
tresses,
fair
and
ambrosial,
flowing
from
her
immortal
head.
Then
she
clad
her
in
her
fragrant
robe

Then
Aphrodite
the

of

answered
her
:
"

of

Kronos,
say
the
thing

Then
with
crafty

the
lady

answered
hei

for
thou
sleepest
in
the
arms
of

the
chief

Therewith
from
her
breast
she
loosed
the
broidered
girdle,
fair-
wrought,
wherein
are
all
her
enchantments;
therein
are
love,
and
desire,
and
loving
converse,
that
steals
the
wits
even
of
the
wise.
This
girdle
she
laid
in
her
hands,
and
spake,
and
said
:
"
Lo
now,
take
this
girdle
and
lay
it
up
in

this

wherein
all

;
methinks
thou

which

So
spake
she,
and
the
ox-eyed
lady
Hera
smiled,
and
smiling
laid
up
the
zone
within
her
breast.
Then
the
daughter
of
Zeus,
Aphrodite,
went
to
her
house,
and
Hera,
rushing
down,
left
the
peak
of
Olympus,
and
touched
on
Pieria
and
pleasant
Emathia,
and
sped
over
the
snowy
hills
of
the
Thracian
horsemen,
even
over
the
topmost
crests,
nor
grazed
the
ground
with
her
feet,
and
from
Athos
she
fared
across
the
foaming
sea,
and
came
to
Lemnos,
the
city
of
godlike
Thoas.
There
she
met
Sleep,
the
brother
of
Death,
and
clasped
her
hand
in
his,
and
spake
and
called
him
by
name
:
"
Sleep,
lord
of
all

and
of
all

if
ever
thou
didst
hear
my
word,
obey
me
again
even
now,
and
I
will
be
grateful
to
thee
always.
Lull
me,
I
pray
thee,

eyes
of

beneath
his
brows,
so
soon
as
I
have
laid
me
down

him
in

I

So
spake
he,
nor
did
she
disobey,
the
white-armed
god-
dess
Hera
;
she
sware
as
he
bade
her,
and
called
all
the
gods
by
name,
even
those
below
Tartaros
that
are
called
Titans.
But
when
she
had
sworn
and
ended
that
oath,
the
twain
left
the
citadel
of
Lemnos,
and
of
Imbros,
clothed
on
in
mist,
and
swiftly
they
accomplished
the
way.
To

Ida
they
came,
the

of

beasts,
to
Lek-

where
first
they
left

and
they
twain
fared
above

and
the

waved
beneath
their

There
Sleep

ere
the

alighted
on
a
tall

the

that
then
in

rose
through

Therein
sat
he,
hidden
by

But
Hera
swiftly
drew
nigh
to
topmost
Gargaros,
the
highest
crest
of

and
Zeus
the

beheld
her.
And
as
he
saw
her,
so
love
came
over
his
deep
heart,
even
as
when
first
they
mingled
with
each
other
in
delight,
and
went
together
to
the
couch,
their
dear
parents
knowing
it
not.
And
he
stood
before
her,
and
spoke,
and
said
:
"
Hera,
with
what
desire
comest
thou
thus
hither
from
Olympus,
and
thy

and

Then
with
crafty

lady

answered
him
:
"

Then
Zeus
the
cloud-gatherer
answered
her
and
said
:
"
Hera,
fear
not
lest
any
god,
or
any
man
should
spy
the
thing,
so
great
a
golden
cloud
will
I
cast
all
over
thee.
Nay,
methinks
not
even
the
sun
might
see
through
it,
the
sun&gt;
whose
light
is
keenest
of
all
to
behold."
So
spake
he,
and
the
son
of
Kronos
clasped
his
consort
in
his
arms.
And
beneath
them
the
divine
earth
sent
forth
fresh
new
grass,
and
dewy
lotus,
and
crocus,
and
hyacinth,
thick
and
soft,
that
raised
them
aloft
from
the
ground.
Therein
they
lay,
and
were
clad
on
with
a
fair
golden
cloud,
whence
fell
drops
of
glittering
dew.
Thus
slept
the
Father
in
quiet
on
the
crest
of
Gargaros,
by
Sleep
and
love
overcome,
with
his
bedfellow
in
his
arms.
But
sweet
Sleep
started
and
ran
to
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
to
tell
his
tidings
to
the
god
that
holdeth
and
shaketh
the
earth.
And
he
stood
near
him,
and
spake
winged
words
:
"
Eagerly
now,
Poseidon,
do
thou
aid
the
Danaans,
and
give
them
glory
for
a
little
space,
while
yet
Zeus
sleepeth,
for
over
him
have
I
shed
soft
slumber,
and
Hera
hath
beguiled
him
to
couch
in
love."
So
he
spake,
and
passed
to
the
renowned
tribes
of
men,
and
still
the
more
did
he
set
on
Poseidon
to
aid
the
Danaans,
who
straightway
sprang
far
afront
of
the
foremost,
and
called
to
them
:
"
Argives,
are
we
again
to
yield
the
victory
to
Hector,
son
of
Priam,
that
he
may
take
our

and
win
renown
?
Nay,
even
so
he
saith
and
declareth
that
he
will
do,
for
that
Achilles
by
the
hollow

abides
angered

But
for
him
there
will
be
no
such
extreme
regret,
if
we
spur
us
on
to
aid

the

Nay
come,
as

are

cover

heads
with

and

So

he,

they

him
eagerly
and

him.
And
them
the
kings
themselves
arrayed,

tender
flesh.
And
Hector
was
enraged
because
his
swift
spear
had
flown
vainly
from
his
hand,
and
he
retreated
into
the
throng
of
his
fellows,
avoiding
Fate.
Then
as
he
was
departing
the
great
Telamonian
Aias
smote
him
with
a
huge
stone
;
for
many
stones,
the
props
of
swift
ships,
were
rolled
among
the
feet
of
the
fighters
;
one
of
these
he
lifted,
and
smote
Hector
on
the
breast,
over
the
shield-rim,
near
the
neck,
and
made
him
spin
like
a
top
with
the
blow,
that
he
reeled
round
and
round.
And
even
as
when
an
oak
falls
uprooted
beneath
the
stroke
of
father
Zeus,
and
a
dread
savour
of
brimstone
arises
therefrom,
and
whoso
stands
near
and
beholds
it
has
no
more
courage,
for
dread
is
the
bolt
of
great
Zeus,
even
so
fell
mighty
Hector
straightway
in
the
dust.
And
the
spear
fell
from
his
hand,
but
his
shield
and
helm
were
made
fast
to
him,
and
round
him
rang
his
arms
adorned
with
bronze.
Then
with
a
loud
cry
they
ran
up,
the
sons
of
the
Achaians,
hoping
to
drag
him
away,
and
they
cast
showers
of
darts.
But
not
one
availed
to
wound
or
smite
the
shepherd
of
the
host;
before
that
might
be
the
bravest
gathered
about
him,
Polydamas,
and
Aineias,
and
goodly
Agenor,
and
Sarpedon,
leader
of
the
Lykians,
and
noble
Glaukos,
and
of
the
rest
not
one
was
heedless
of
him,
but
they
held
their
round
shields
in
front
of
him,
and
his
comrades
lifted
him
in
their
arms,
and
bare
him
out
of
the
battle,
till
he
reached
his
swift
horses
that
were
standing
waiting
for
him,
with
the
charioteer
and
the
fair-dight
chariot
at
the
rear
of
the
combat
and
the
war.
These
toward
the
city
bore
him
heavily
moaning.
Now
when
they
came
to
the
ford
of
the
fair-flowing
river,
of
eddying
Xanthos,
that
immortal
Zeus
begat,
there
they
lifted
him
from
the
chariot
to
the
ground,
and
poured
water
over
him,
and
he
gat
back
his
breath,
and
looked
up
with
his
eyes,
and
sitting
on
his

heels
kneeling,
he
vomited
black
blood.
Then
agaio
sank
back
on
the
ground,
and
black
night
covered
hi
the
stroke
still
conquering
his
spirit.
Now
the
Argives
when
they
saw
Hector
departed
,
yet
the
more
upon
the
Trojans,
and
were
mindful
of
the
delight
of
battle.
There
far
the
foremost
did
swift
A
son
of
Oileus,
leap
on
Satnios,
son
of
Enops,
and
woun
him
with
his
sharp
spear;
Satnios
whom
the
fair
N
nymph
bore
to
Enops
as
he
herded
his
flocks
by
the
banks
of
Satnioeis.
Him
did
the
spear-famed
son
of
Oileus
draw
nigh,
and
wounded
him
on
the
flank,
and
he
fell,
and
round
him
did
Trojans
and
Danaans
join
in
strong
battle.
Then
to
his
aid
came
Polydamas,
the
wielder
of
the
spear,
son
of
Panthoos,
and
smote
Prothoenor
on
the
right
shoulder,
Prothoenor,
son
of
Areilykos,
and
through
his
shoulder
went
the
mighty
spear,
and
he
fell
in
the
dust,
and
clutched
the
earth
with
his
palm.
And
Polydamas
boasted
over
;
terribly,
crying
aloud
:
"
Verily
methinks
that
again
from
the

hand
of
the
high-hearted
son
of
Panthoos,

Nay,

spake

and

And
chiefly
he
roused
the
wrath
of
Un-

of

Aias,
for
the
man

Swiftly
he
cast

noble
Polydamas
:
"
Consider,
Polydamas,
and
tell
me
truly,
whether
thou
sayst
not
that
this
man
is
worth
slaying
in
place
of
Prothoenor:he
seems
to
me
no
coward,
nor
born
of
cowards,
but
a
brother
of
horse-taming
Antenor,
or
a
child,
for
he
most
closely
favoureth
his
house."
So
he
spake,
knowing
the
truth
right
well,
and
sorrow
seized
the
hearts
of
the
Trojans.
Then
Akamas
wounded
Promachos
the
Boiotian
with
his
spear,
from
where
he
stood
above
his
brother,
that
Promachos
was
dragging
away
by
the
feet.
Over
him
Akamas
boasted
terribly,
shouting
aloud
:
"
Ye
Argive
bowmen,
insatiate
of
threats,
verily
not
for
us
alone
shall
there
be
struggle
and
toil,
nay,
but
even
as
we
shall
ye
likewise
perish.
Consider
how
your
Promachos
sleepeth,
vanquished
by
my
spear,
that
my
brother's
blood-
price
may
not
be
long
unpaid.
Even
for
this
it
is
that
a
man
may
well
pray
to
leave
some
kinsman
in
his
halls,
that
will
avenge
his
fall."
So
he
spake,
and
sorrow
came
on
the
Argives
at
his
boast.
And
chiefly
he
stirred
the
heart
of
the
wise
Peneleos,
who
made
for
Akamas,
and
Akamas
abode
not
the
onset
of
the
prince
Peneleos.
But
Peneleos
wounded
Ilioneus,
the
son
of
Phorbas,

in

that
Hermes
loved
most

of
all

and
gave

Then

those
in

these
driving
them
on

And
Hector
he
saw
lying

him,
the

had
pity

terribly
he
spoke
to

with
fierce
look
:

So

spake
unto
him
winged

:

But
if
indeed
thou
speakest
the
truth
and
soothly,
go
thou
now
among
the
tribes
of
the
gods,
and
call
Iris
to
come
hither,
and
Apollo,
the
renowned
archer,
that
Iris
may
go
among
the
host
of
mail-clad
Achaians
and
tell
Poseidon
the
prince
to
cease
from
the
war,
and
get
him
unto
his

house.
But
let
Phoebus
Apollo
spur
Hector
on
to
the
war,
and
breathe
strength
into
him
again,
and
make
him
forget
his
anguish,
that
now
wears
down
his
heart,
and
drive
the
Achaians
back
again,
when
he
hath
stirred
in
them
craven
fear.
Let
them
flee
and
fall
among
the
many-benched
ships
of
Achilles
son
of
Peleus,
and
he
shall
rouse
his
own
comrade,
Patroklos
;
and
him
shall

Hector
slay

in

after
that
he
has
slain
many
other
youths,
and
among
them
my
son,
noble
Sarpedon.
In
wrath
therefor
shall
goodly
Achilles
slay
Hector.
From
that
hour
verily
will
I
cause
a
new
pursuit
from
the
ships,
that
shall
endure
continually,
even
until
the
Achaians
take

counsels
of

But
before

hour
neither
do
I
cease
in

wrath,
nor
will
I
suffer
any
other
of
the
Immortals
to
help
the
Danaans
there,
before
I
accomplish
that
desire
of
the
son
of
Peleus,
as
I
promised
him
at
the
first,
and
confirmed
the
same
with
a
nod
of
my
head,
on
that
day
when
the
goddess
Thetis
clasped
my
knees,
imploring
me
to
honour
Achilles,
the
sacker
of

So
spake
he,
nor
did
the
white-armed
goddess
Hera
dis-
obey
him,
and
she
sped
down
from
the
hills
of
Ida
to
high
Olympus.
And
even
as

he

swiftly

she

:

Then
the
white-armed
goddess
Hera
answered
her,
s.
.
"Ask
me
not
concerning
this,
O
goddess
Themis
;

how
overweening
is

unyielding.
But
do

So
spake
the
lady
Hera,
and
sat
her
down,
while
the
gods
were
heavy
at
heart
in
the
hall
of
Zeus.
And
she
laughed
with
her
lips,
but
her
forehead
above
her
dark
brows
was
not
gladdened,
and
indignantly
she
spake
among
them
all

he

that

in

Wherefore
do
ye
content
yourselves
with

of

So
spake
she,
but
Ares
smote
his
strong
thighs
with
1
hands
flatlings,
and
sorrowing
he
spake:
"
Hold

So
spake
he,
and
bade
yoke
his
horses,
Fear
and
Dread,
and
himself
did
on
his
shining
harness.
Thereby
would
yet

and

anger
have
been

not
Athene,
in
terror
for
the
sake
of
all
the
gods,
leaped
out
through
the
doorway,
and
left
the
throne
wherein
she
sat,
and
taken
from
Ares'
head
the
helmet,
and
the
shield
from
his
shoulders,
and
drawn
the
spear
of
bronze
from
his
stalwart
hand,
and
set
it
apart,
and
then
with
words
she
rebuked
the
im-
petuous
Ares:
"Mad
that
thou
art,
and
distraught
of
wit—
this
is
thy
bane
!
Verily
thou
hast
ears
and
hearest
not,
and
perished
have
thine
understanding
and
thine
awe.
Hearest
thou
not
what
she
saith,
the
white-armed
goddess
Hera,
that
even
now
is
come
from
Olympian
Zeus
?
Dost
thou
wish
both
thyself
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
mischief
and
so
return
to
Olympus
ruefully,
of
necessity,
and
for
all
the
other
gods
to
sow
the
seed
of
a
great
wrong
?
For
straightway
will
he
leave
the
high-hearted
Trojans
and
the
Achaians,
and
to
us
will
he
come
to
make
tumult
in
Olympus
:
and
he
will
clutch
us
each
in
turn,
the
blameless
with
the
guilty.
Wherefore
now
again
I
bid
thee
to
abate
thine
anger
for
thy
son,
for
already
many
a
man
stronger
than
he,
and
more
hardy
of
his

fallen,
or
yet
will
fall
;
and
a
hard
thing
it
is
to
save
the
lineage
and
offspring
of
all
men."
So
spake
she,
and
made
impetuous
Ares
sit
down
on
his
throne.
But
Hera
called
Apollo
without
the
hall,
and
Iris,
that
is
the
messenger
of
the
immortal
gods,
and
she
spake
winged
words,
and
addressed
them,
saying
:
"

found

round

And
tl

came
before

of

the

stood
there,

he
was
no

when
he

for
that
speedily
they
had
obeyed
the

of

And
to

he

:

Then,
in
great
displeasure
the

of

answered
her
:
"

to
me
fell
the
hoary
sea,
to
be
my
habitation
for
ever,
when
we
shook
the
lots
:
and
Hades
drew
the
murky
dark-
ness,
and
Zeus
the
wide
heaven,
in
clear
air
and
clouds,
but
the
earth
and
high
Olympus
are
yet
common
to
all.
Where-
fore
no
whit
will
I
walk
after
the
will
of
Zeus,
but
quietly
let
him
abide,
for
all
his
strength,
in
his
third
portion.
And
with
the
might
of
his
hands
let
him
not
strive
to
terrify
me
withal,
as
if
I
were
a
coward.
Better
for
him
were
it
to
threaten
with
terrible
words
his
daughters
and
his
sons,
that
himself
begat,
who
will
perforce
listen
to
whatso
he
enjoins."
Then
the
fleet
wind-footed
Iris
answered
him
:
"
Is
it
indeed
thy
will,
O
dark-haired
embracer
of
the
earth,
that
even
thus
I
shall
carry
to
Zeus
this
message,
hard
and
froward,
01
wilt
thou
turn
thee
at
all,
for
the
hearts
of
the
good
may
be
turned?
Thou
knowest
how
the
Erinyes
do
always
follow
to
aid
the
elder-born."
Then
he
answered
her
again,
Poseidon,
the
Shaker
of
the
earth
:
"
Goddess
Iris,
most
duly
hast
thou
spoken
this
word.
Yea,
an
excellent
thing
is
this,
when
the
bearer
of
a
message
has
a
prudent
wit.
Yet
this
is
a
terrible
grief
that
cometh
on
heart
and
spirit,
whenso
any
desireth
to
up-
braid
with
angry
words
his
peer
to
whom
fate
hath
assigned
an
equal
share
with
himself.
But
verily
now
will
I
yield,

all
mine

;
but
another
thing
will
I
tell
thee,
and
make
this
threat
in
my
heart,
that
if
against
my
will,
and
the
will
of
Athene,

prey,
and
of

u&gt;
I
Argives,
let
him
know
this,
that
our
wrath
will
Lc
inap
peasable."
So
spake
the
Shaker
of
the
earth,
and
left
the
host
of
the
Achaians,
and
passed
to
the
sea,
and
sank,
and
sorely
they
missed
him,
the
heroes
of
the
Achaians.
Then
Zeus,
the
gatherer
of
the
clouds,
spake
to
Apollo,
saying
:
"
Go
now,
dear
Phoebus,
to
Hector
of
the
helm
of
bronze,
for,
lo,
already
the
embracer
of
the
world,
the
Earth
shaker,
is
gone
to
the
bright
sea,
shunning
our
utter
wrath,
ay.
and
had
he
not
done
so,
even
the
others
would
have
heard
of
our
strife,
even
the
gods
of
the
nether
world,
that
are
with
Kronos.
But
better
far
is
this,
both
for
me,
and
for
him,
that,
despite
his
wrath,
he
should
yield
to
my
hands,
for
not
without
sweat
would
this
strife
have
been
accomplished.
But
do
thou
take
in
thy
hands
the
tasselled
aegis,
and
shak
fiercely
and
affright
the
Achaian
heroes.
But,
thou
Archer-
God,
let
glorious
Hector
be
thy
care,
and
rouse
in
him
great
wrath
even
till
the
Achaians
come
in
their
flight
to
the
ships,
and
the
Hellespont.
And
from
that
moment
will
I
devise
word
and
deed
wherewithal
the
Achaians
may
take
breath
again
from
their
toil."
So
spake
he,
nor
was
Apollo
deaf
to
the
word
of
the
Father,
but
he
went
down
the
hills
of
Ida

bearing
Zeus
began
to
revive
him.
Then
far-darting
Apollo
stood
near
him,
and
spake
to
him
:
"
Hector,
son
of
Priam,
why
dost
thou
sit
fainting
apart
from
the
others?
Is
it
perchance
that
some
trouble
cometh
upon
thee
?"
Then,
with
faint
breath
answered
him
Hector
of
the
glanc-
ing
helm
:
"
Nay,
but
who
art
thou,
best
of
the
gods,
who
enquirest
of
me
face
to
face
?
Dost
thou
not
know
that
by
the
hindmost
row
of
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
Aias
of
the
loud
war-cry
smote
me
on
the
breast
with
a
stone,
as
I
was
slaying
his
comrades,
and
made
me
cease
from
mine
im-
petuous
might
?
And
verily
I
deemed
that
this
very
day
I
should
pass
to
the
dead,
and
the
house
of
Hades,
when
I
had
gasped
my
life
away."
Then
prince
Apollo
the
Far-darter
answered
him
again
:
"
Take
courage
now,
so
great
an
ally
hath
the
son
of
Kronos
sent
thee
out
of
Ida,
to
stand
by
thee
and
defend
thee,
even
Phoebus
Apollo
of
the
golden
sword,
me
who
of
old
defend
thee,
thyself
and
the
steep
citadel.
But
come
now
bid
thy
many
charioteers
drive
their
swift
steeds
against
the
hollow
ships,
and
I
will
go
before
and
make
smooth
all
the
way
for
the
chariots,
and
will
put
to
flight
the
Achaian
heroes."
So
he
spake,
and
breathed
great
might
into
the
shepherd
of
the
host,
and
even
as
when
a
stalled
horse,
full
fed
at
the
manger,
breaks
his
tether
and
speedeth
at
the
gallop
over
the
plain
exultingly,
being
wont
to
bathe
in
the
fair-flow-
ing
stream,
and
holds
his
head
on
high,
and
the
mane
floweth
about
his
shoulders,
and
he
trusteth
in
his
glory,
and
nimbly
his
knees
bear
him
to
the
haunts
and
pasture
of
the
mares,
even
so
Hector
lightly
moved
his
feet
and
knees,
urging
on
his
horsemen,
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
god.
But
as
when

stag,
or

and

the

Then
to
them
spake
Thoas,

of

he

among

for

doth
he

But
come,

Let

So
spake
he,
and
they
heard
him
eagerly,

3oo
ILIAD
XV,
306-336.
Now
the
Trojans
drave
forward
in
close
ranks,
and
with
long
strides
Hector
led
them,
while
in
front
of
him
went
Phoebus
Apollo,
his
shoulders
wrapped
in
cloud,
and
still
he
held
the
fell
aegis,
dread,
circled
with
a
shaggy
fringe,
and
gleaming,
that
Hephaistos
the
smith
gave
to
Zeus,
to
bear
for
the
terror
of
men
;
with
this
in
his
hands
did
he
lead
the
host.
Now
the
Argives
abode
them
in
close
ranks,
and
shrill
the
cry
arose
on
both
sides,
and
the
arrows
leaped
from
the
bow-strings,
and
many
spears
from
stalwart
hands,
whereof
some
stood
fast
in
the
flesh
of
young
men
swift
in
fight,
but
many
halfway,
ere
ever
they
reached
the
white
flesh,
stuck
in
the
ground,
longing
to
glut
themselves
with
flesh.
Now
so
long
as
Phoebus
Apollo
held
the
aegis
un-
moved
in
his
hands,
so
long
the
darts
smote
either
side
amain,
and
the
folk
fell.
But
when
he
looked
face
to
face
on
the
Danaans
of
the
swift
steeds,
and
shook
the
aegis,
and
himself
shouted
mightily,
he
quelled
their
heart
in
their
breast,
and
they
forgot
their
impetuous
valour.
And
as
when
two
wild
beasts
drive
in
confusion
a
herd
of
kine,
or
a
great
flock
of
sheep,
in
the
dark
hour
of
black
night,
coming
swiftly
on
them
when
the
herdsman
is
not
by,
even
so
were
the
Achaians
terror-stricken
and
strengthless,
for
Apollo
sent
a
panic
among
them,
but
still
gave
renown
to
the
Trojans
and
Hector.
Then
man
fell
upon
man,
when
the
close
fight
was
scat-
tered.
Hector
slew
Stichios,
and
Arkesilaos,
one
a
leader
of
the
mail-clad
Boiotians,
the
other
the
true
comrade
of
great-hearted
Menestheus.
And
Aineias
slew
Medon
and
lasos,
whereof
one
was
the
bastard
son
of
divine
Oileus,
even
Medon,
brother
of
Aias,
but
he
dwelt
in
Phylake,
far
from
his
own
country,
for
that
he
had
slain
s
man
the
brother
of
his
stepmother
Eriopis,
the
wife
of
Oileus,
ILIAD
XV,
337-306.
30,
But
lasos
was
a
leader
of
the
Athenians,
and
was
called
the
son
of
Sphelos,
the
son
of
Boukolos.
And
Poiydamas
slew
Mekisteus,
and
Polites
Echios
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle,
and
noble
Agenor
overcame
Klonios.
And
Deu^aus
as
he
was
flying
among
the
fighters
in
the
foremost
rank
1
,
smote
behind
the
lower
part
of
the
shoulder,
and
drave
the
bronze
clean
through.
Now
while
they
were
stripping
the
spoil
from
these,
c
.
then
the
Achaians
were
dashing
into
the
delved
fosse,
and
against
the
palisade,
fleeing
hither
and
thither
in
their
ter-
ror,
and
were
driven
perforce
within
the
wall,
but
Hertur
called
with
a
loud
shout
to
the
Trojans
:
"
Make
ye
8
the
ships,
and
leave
the
bloody
spoils.
Whomsoever
I
&gt;!-.all
see
apart
from
the
ships
on
the
other
side,
his
death
will
1
there
devise,
nor
forthwith
shall
his
kinsmen
and
kinswomen
lay
him
dead
on
the
funeral
fire,
but
dogs
shall
tear
him
in
front
of
our
citadel."
So
speaking
he
smote
his
horses
on
the
shoulder
with
the
lash,
and
called
aloud
on
the
Trojans
along
the
ranks.
And
they
all
cried
out,
and
level
with
his
held
the
ste
that
drew
their
chariots,
with
a
marvellous
din,
and
in
front
of
them
Phoebus
Apollo
lightly
dashed
down
with
his
:
the
banks
of
the
deep
ditch,
and
cast
them
into
the
midst
thereof,
making
a
bridgeway
long
and
wide
as
is
a
cast,
when
a
man
throws
to
make
trial
of
his
strength.
Thereby
the
Trojans
poured
forward
in
their
battal:
while
in
their
van
Apollo
held
the
splendid

So
they
were
halting,
and
abiding
by
the
ships,
call-
ing
each
to
other
;
and
lifting
their
hands
to
all
the
gods
did
each
man
pray
vehemently,
and
chiefly
prayed
Gerenian
Nestor,
the
Warden
of
the
Achaians,
stretching
his
hand
towards
the
starry
heaven
:
"
O
father
Zeus,
if
ever
any
one
of
us
in
wheat-bearing
Argos
did
burn
to
thee
fat
thighs
of
bull
or
sheep,
and
prayed
that
he
might
return,
and
thou
didst
promise
and
assent
thereto,
of
these
things
be
thou
mindful,
and
avert,
Olympian,
the
pitiless
day,
nor
suffer
the
Trojans
thus
to
overcome
the
Achaians."
So
spake
he
in
his
prayer,
and
Zeus,
the
Lord
of
counsel,
thundered
loudly,
hearing
the
prayers
of
the
ancient
son
of
Neleus.
But
the
Trojans,
when
they
heard
the
thunder
of
aegis-
bearing
Zeus,
rushed
yet
the
more
eagerly
upon
the
Argives,
and
were
mindful
of
the
joy
of
battle.
And
as
when
a
great
wave
of
the
wide
sea
sweeps
over
the
bulwarks
of
a
ship,
the
might
of
the
wind
constraining
it,
which
chiefly
swells
the
waves,
even
so
did
the
Trojans
with
a
great
cry
bound
over
the
wall,
and
drave
their
horses
on,
and
at
the
hind-
most
row
of
the
ships
were
fighting
hand
to
hand
with
double-pointed
spears,
the
Trojans
from
the
chariots,
but
the
Achaians
climbing
up
aloft,
from
the
black
ships
with
long
pikes
that
they
had
lying
in
the
ships
for
battle
at
sea,
jointed
pikes
shod
at
the
head
with
bronze.
Now
Patroklos,
as
long
as
the
Achaians
and
Trojans
were
fighting
about
the
wall,
without
the
swift
ships,
sat
in
the
hut
of
kindly
Eurypylos,
and
was
making
him
glad
with
talk,
and
on
his
cruel
wound
was
laying
herbs,
to
medicine
his
dark
pain.
But
when
he
perceived
the
Trojans
rush-
ing
over
the
wall,
and
the
din
and
flight
of
the
Danaans
began,
then
did
he
groan,
and
smote
his
two
thighs
with
his
hands
flatlings,
and
sorrowing
he
spake
:
"

at

I

with
thee
here,
though

for

But

?
and

of

Even
as
he
spake,
his
feet
were
bearing
him
aw.,
the
Achaians
abode
the
onset
of
the
Trojans
steadfastly,
yet
availed
not
to
drive
them,
though
fewer
they
were,
from
the
ships
:
neither
at
all
could
the
Trojans
break
the
ranks
of
Danaans
and
pour
among
the
huts
and
the
ships.
Hut
even
as
the

doth
straighten
the

of

in
the
hands
of
a
cunning
shipwright
that
is

by
the
inspiration
of
Athene,
so
equally
was
strained
their
war
and

and

he
fell
with
a
crash,
and
the
torch
dropped
from
his
hand.
But
Hector,
when
he
beheld
with
his
eyes
his
cousin
fallen
in
the
dust,
in
front
of
the
black
ship,
called
with
a
cry
to
the
Trojans
and
Lykians
:
"
Ye

and

So
spake
he,
and
hurled
at

with
a
shining
sj
and
Aias

missed,

above
the
ear
with
the
sharp
bronze,
even
as
he
stood
near
Aias
;
and
backward
in
the
dust
he
fell
to
earth
from
the
stern
of
the
ship,
and
his
limbs
were
loosened.
And
Aias
shuddered,
and
spake
to
his
brother
:
"
Dear
Teukros,
lo
our
true
comrade
hath
been
slain,
even
the
son
of
Mastor
out
of
Kythera
whom
we
honoured
at
home
in
the
halls
like
our
own
parents.
Him
hath
great-hearted
Hector
slain.
Where
now
are
thy
swift
shafts
of
doom,
and
the
bow
that
Phoebus
Apollo
gave
thee
?
"
So
spake
he,
and
the
other
marked
him,
and
ran,
and
came
and
stood
close
by
him,
with
the
bended
bow
in
his
hand,
and
the
quiver
with
the
arrows,
and
right
swiftly
he
showered
his
shafts
upon
the
Trojans.
And
he
smote
Kleitos,
the
splendid
son
of
Peisenor,
the
comrade
of
Poly
damas,
the
haughty
son
of
Panthoos,
with
the
reins
in
his
hand,
as
he
was
busy
with
the
horses,
for
thither
was
he
driving
them
where
far
the
most
of
the
companies
were
broken
in
confusion,
and
he
was
showing
a
favour
to
Hector
and
the
Trojans.
But
swiftly
on
himself
came
his
bane,
that
not
one
of
them
could
ward
off
from
him,
despite
their
desire.
For
the
woful
arrow
lighted
on
the
back
of
his
neck,
and
he
fell
from
the
chariot,
and
back
started
his
horses,
shak-
ing
the
empty
car.
But
straightway
the
prince
Polydamas
beheld
it,
and
was
the
first
to
come
over
against
the
horses.
Them
he
gave
to
Astynoos,
the
son
of
Protiaon,
and
enjoined
him
straitly
to
hold
the
horses
close
at
hand,
and
look
on,
and
himself
went
back,
and
mingled
with
the
foremost
fighters.
Then
Teukros
aimed
another
shaft
against
Hector
of
the
helm
of
bronze,
and
would
have
made
cease
the
battle
by
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
if
he
had
smitten
him
in
his
prowess
and
taken
his
life
away.
But
he
escaped
not
the
wise
mind
of
Zeus,
who
guarded
Hector,
but
took
away
the
praise
from
Teukros

of

to

:

Then
the
great

son
of

answered
him
saying
:
"
Yea,

the

So
spake
he,
and
Teukros
set
the
bow
within

huts
again,
but
round

he
set
a

So
spake
he
and
aroused
the
might
and
the
spirit
of
every
man.
But
Aias
again,
on
the
other
side,
called
unto
his
comrades
:
"
Shame
on
you,
Argives
:
now
is
one
thing
sure,
either
that
we
must
perish
utterly,
or
be
saved
and
drive
the
peril
from
the
ships.
Think
ye
that
if
Hector
of
the
glancing
helm
take
the
ships,
ye
will
come
by
dry
land
each
to
his
own
country?
Hear
ye
not
Hector
exhorting
all
the
host,
so
eager,
verily,
is
he
to
burn
the
ships
?
Truly
he
bids
not
men
to
the
dance
but
to
battle.
And
for
us
there
is
no
better
counsel
nor
de-
vice,
but
to
put
forth
our
hands
and
all
our
might
in
close
combat.
Better
it
were
to
risk
life
or
death,
once
for
all,
than
long
to
be
straitened
in
the
dread
stress
of
battle,
thus
vainly
by
the
ships,
at
the
hands
of
worse
men
than
we
be."
So
spake
he,
and
aroused
the
might
and
the
spirit
of
every
man.
Then
Hector
slew
Schedios,
the
son
of
Perimedes,
a
leader
of
the
Phokians,
while
Aias
slew
Laodamas,
the
leader
of
the
foot-men,
the
noble
son
of
Antenor,
and
Poly-
damas
slew
Otos,
of
Kyllene,
comrade
of
Phyleides,
a
chief
of
the
high-hearted
Epeians.
And
Meges,
when
he
beheld
it
rushed
on
him,
but
Polydamas
stooped
downwards,
and
him
Meges
missed,
—
for
Apollo

not

—
but
he
wounded
Kroismos
in

with
his

And
he
fell
with

and
the

So
spake
he,
and
led
on,
while
the
other
followed
him,
a
godlike
man.
But
the
great
Aias,
son
of
Telamon,
ex-
horted
the
Argives,
saying
:
"
O
friends,
play
the

and
take

yea,
have

For

So
spake
he,
and
they
likewise
themselves
were
eager
to
drive
off
the
others,
and
laid
up
his
word
in
their
hearts,
and
begirt
the

with
a
ring
of

while
Zeus
urged
on
the
Trojans.
Then
Menelaos
of
the
loud
war-cry
ex-
horted
Antilochos,
"
Antilochos,
not
one
of
the
Achaians
is
younger
than
thou,
nor
swifter
of
foot,
nor
strong
as
art
thou
in

;
see
now
if
thou
canst
leap
out,
and
smite
some
man
of
the
Trojans."
So
spake
he,
and
hasted
back
again,
having
heartened
the
other,
and
forth
Antilochos
leaped
from
the
foremost
ranks,
and
cast
his
shining
spear,
glancing
all
around
him,
and
the
Trojans
gave
ground
before
him
when
he
threw.
And
no
vain
dart
threw
he,
but
smote
Melanippos,
the
proud
son
of
Hiketaon,
as
he
was
returning
to
the
combat
;
on
the
breast
hard
by
the
nipple
he
smote
him.
And
he
fell
with
a
crash,
and
darkness
covered
his
eyes.
And
Antilochos
set
on
like
a
hound
that
rushes
upon

that
the

hath
aimed
at

smitten
as
it

Even
so
upon
thee,
Melanippos,
leaped
Antilochos
steadfast
in
battle,
to
spoil
thy
harness.
But
noble
Hector
marked
him,
and
came
running
against
him
through
the
battle.
But
Antilochos
abode

showered
upon

he
turned,
and
stood,

had

Now
the
Trojans,
like

lions,
rushed
upon
the
ships,
fulfilling
the

of
Zeus,
that
ever
was
musing

so
the

abode
the

and
fled
not

But
Hector
shining
with

on

sides
leaped
on

fell
upon
them,

with
the
rear
or
the
van
of
the
cattle,
but
the
lion
leaps
into
the
midst,
and
devours
a
cow,
and
they
all
tremble
for
fear,
even
so
the
Achaians
all
were
made
terribly
adread
by
Hector
and
father
Zeus.
But
Hector
slew
Periphetes
of
Mykene
only,
the
dear
son
of
Kopreus,
that
was
wont
to
go
on
the
errands
of
Eurystheus,
to
the
mighty
Herakles.
From
him,
a
far
baser
father,
was
born
a
better
son,
in
all
manner
of
excellence,
in
fleetness
of
foot,
and
in
war,
and
of
mind
he
was
wise
among
the
first
of
the
Myken-
aeans.
He
thus
then
yielded
Hector
the
greater
glory.
For
as
he
turned
back,
he
tripped
against
the
rim
of
his
shield
which
he
was
wont
to
bear,
a
shield
that
reached
to
the
feet,
a
fence
against
javelins
—
thereon
he
stumbled,
and
fell
back,
and
his
helm
rang
wondrously
around
his
temples
as
he
fell.
And
Hector
quickly
spied
it,
and
ran
up
swiftly
and
stood
by
him,
and
fixed
a
spear
in
his
breast,
and
slew
him
hard
by
his
dear
comrades
that
could
not
aid
him,
despite
all
their
sorrow
for
their
friend,
for
themselves
greatly
dreaded
noble
Hector.

For

restrained
them
and
ceaselessly
they
kept

each
to

Now
Gerenian
Nestor
above
all,
UK
of
the
Achaians,
implored
each
man
by
the
memo:
that
begat
him,
and
spake
beseechingly
:

Let

For

I

you,
for

of

to

stoutly,
nor

So
spake
he,
and
roused
each
man's
courage
and
might,
and
from
their
eyes
Athene
lifted
the
wondrous
cloud
mist,
and
light
came
mightily
upon
them
from
cither
si
both
from
the
side
of
the
ships,
and
from
the
quarter
of
even-balanced
war.
And
they
beheld
Hector
of
the
loud
war-cry,
and
his
comrades,
both
them
that
stood
in

and
were
not

and
all

while

even
so
Aias
went
with
long
strides,
over
many
a
deck
of
the
swift
ships,
and
his
voice
went
up
unto
heaven.
And
always
with
terrible
cries
he
summoned
the
Danaans
to
defend
the
ships
and
the
huts.
Nor
did
Hector
abide
in
the
throng
of
well-armed
Trojans,
but
even
as
a
tawny
eagle
rushes
on
a
flock
of
winged
fowl,
that
are
feeding
by
a
riverside,
a
flock
of
geese,
or
cranes,
or
long-necked
swans,
even
so
Hector
made
straight
for
a
black-beaked
ship,
rushing
right
on
it,
and
mightily
Zeus
urged
him
on
from
behind
with
his
strong
hand,
and
roused
on
the
host
along
with
him.
So
again
keen
battle
was
set
by
the
ships.
Thou
wouldst
deem
that
unwearied
and
unworn
they
met
each
other
in
war,
so
eagerly
they
fought.
And
in
their
striving
they
were
minded
thus
;
the
Achaians
verily
deemed
that
never
would
they
flee
from
the
danger,
but
perish
there,
but
the
heart
of
each
Trojan
hoped
in
his
breast,
that
they
should
fire
the
ships,
and
slay
the
heroes
of
the
Achaians.
With
these
imaginations
they
stood
to
each
other,
and
Hector
seized
the
stern
of
a
seafaring
ship,
a
fair
ship,
swift
on
the
brine,
that
had
borne
Protesilaos
to
Troia,
but
brought
him
not
back
again
to
his
own
country.
Now
round
his
ship
the
Achaians
and
Trojans
warred
on
each
other
hand
to
hand,
nor
far
apart
did
they
endure
the
flights
of
arrows,
nor
of
darts,
but
standing
hard
each
by
other,
with
one
heart,
with
sharp
axes
and
hatchets
they
fought,
and
with
great
swords,
and
double
-pointed
spears.
And
many
fair
brands,
dark
-
scabbarded
and
hilted,
fell
to
the
ground,
some
from
the
hands,
some
from
off
the
shoulders
of
warring
men,
and
the
black
earth
ran
with
blood.
But
Hector,
after
that
once
he
had
seized
the
ship's
stern,
left
not
his
hold,
keeping
the
ensign
in
his
hands,
and
he
called
to
the
Trojans
:

So

And
Aias
no

he

and
he
left

Tl.
then
he
stood
on

watch,
and
with
his
spear
he
ever
drave
the
Trojans
from
the
ships,
whosoever
brought
unwearied
fire,
and
ever
he
shouted
terribly,
calling
to
the
Danaans
:
"O

BOOK

How
Patroklos
fought
in
the
armour
of
Achilles,
and
drove
the
Trojans
from
the
ships,
but
was
slain
at
last
by
Hector.
So
they
were
warring
round
the
well-timbered
ship,
but
Patroklos
drew
near
Achilles,
shepherd
of
the
host,
and
he
shed
warm
tears,
even
as
a
fountain
of
dark
water
that
down
a
steep
cliff
pours
its
cloudy
stream.
And
noble
swift-footed
Achilles
when
he
beheld
him
was
grieved
for
his
sake,
and
accosted
him,
and
spake
winged
words,
saying
:
"
Wherefore
weepest
thou,
Patroklos,
like
a
fond
little
maid,
that
runs
by
her
mother's
side,
and
bids
her
mother
take
her
up,
snatching
at
her
gown,
and
hinders
her
in
her
going,
and
tearfully
looks
at
her,
till
the
mother
takes
her
up
?
like
her,
Patroklos,
dost
thou
let
fall
soft
tears.
Hast
thou
aught
to
tell
to
the
Myrmidons,
or
to
me
myself,
or
is
it
some
tidings
out
of
Phthia
that
thou
alone
hast
heard
?
They
say
that
Menoitios
son
of
Aktor
still
lives
:
and
Peleus
son
of
Aiakos
lives
yet
among
the
Myrmidons,
for
which
twain,

they
dead,

Or
dost
thou
lament
for
the

of
the
Argives,
—
how
they
perish

through
their
own
transgression
?
Speak
out,
and
hide
it
not

thy
spirit,
that
we
may

But
with
a
heavy
groan
didst
thou
speak
unto
him,
O
knight
Patroklos
:
"

in

it
was
to

A

to
me
is
this,
after
all
the
toils
that
my
heart
hath
endured.
The
maiden
that
the
sons
of
the
Achaians
chose

as
my
prize,
and
that
I
won
with
my

when
I

But

No

may

verily
I
said
that
I
would
not
cease
from
my
wrath,
until
that
time
when
to
mine
own
ships
should
come
the
war-cry
and
the
battle.
But
do
thou
on
thy
shoulders
my
famous
harness,
and
lead
the
war-loving
Myrmidons
to
the
fight,
if
indeed
the
dark
cloud
of
the
Trojans
hath
mightily
surrounded
the
ships,
and
if
the
Argives
are
driven
back
to
the
shore
of
the
sea,
holding
but
a
narrow
space
of
land,
and
the
whole
town
of
Troy
hath
come
boldly
against
them.
Yea,
for
they
behold
not
the
vizor
of
my
helm
shining
hard
at

;
swiftly
would
they
flee,
and
fill
the
watercourses
with

if

Agamemnon
had
been

me,
—
but
now

For

the
son
of
Tydeus,

to

Neither

I

Patroklos,

do
thou
fall
on
mightily,
lest
they
even

But
do

And
Aias
knew
in

and
shuddered
at

deeds
of
the
gods,
even
how
Zeus
that

avail
in

and
desired
victory
for
the

Then
Aias
gave
back
out
of
the
darts.
But
the
Trojans
cast
on
the
swift
ship
unwearying
fire,
and
instantly
the
inextinguishable
flame
streamed
over
her
:
so
the
fire
begirt
the
stern,
whereon
Achilles
smote
his
thighs,
and
spake
to
Patroklos
:
"
Arise,
Patroklos
of
the
seed
of
Zeus,
commander
of
the
horsemen,
for
truly
I
see
by
the
ships
the
rush
of
the
consuming
fire.
Up
then,
lest
they
take
the
ships,
and
there
be
no
more
retreat
;
do
on
thy
harness
speedily,
and
I
will
summon
the
host."
So
spake
he,
while
Patroklos
was
harnessing
him
in
shining
bronze.
His
goodly
greaves,
fitted
with
silver
clasps,
he
first
girt
round
his
legs,
and
next
did
on
around
his
breast
the
well-dight
starry
corslet
of
the
swift-footed
son
of
Aiakos.
And
round
his
shoulders
he
cast
a
sword
of
bronze,
with
studs
of
silver,
and
next
took
the
great
and
mighty
shield,
and
on
his
proud
head
set
a
well-wrought
helm
with
a
horse-hair
crest,
and
terribly
nodded
the
crest
from
above.
Then
seized
he
two
strong
lances
that
fitted
his
grasp,
only
he
took
not
the
spear
of
the
noble
son
of
Aiakos,
heavy,
and
huge,
and
stalwart,
that
none
other
of
the
Achaians
could
wield,
but
Achilles
alone
availed
to
wield
it
:
even
the
ashen
Pelian
spear
that
Cheiron
gave
to
his
father
dear,
from
a
peak
of
Pelion,
to
be
the
death
of
warriors.
And
Patroklos
bade
Automedon
to
yoke
the
horses
speedily,
even
Automedon
whom
most
he
honoured
after
Achilles,
the
breaker
of
the
ranks
of
men,
and
whom
he
held
trustiest
in

to
abide
his
call.
And
for
him
Automedon
led
beneath

yoke

But
when
Achilles
had
stationed
them
all,
and
arrayed
them
well
with
their
leaders,
he
laid
on
them
a
strong
command
:
"
Myrmidons,
let
me
find
none
of
you
forgetful
of
the
threats
wherewith
by
the
swift
ships
ye
threatened
the
Trojans,
through
all
the
time
of
my
wrath,
and
ye
did
each
accuse
me,
saying,
'
Hard-hearted
son
of
Peleus,
surely
on
gall
thy
mother
reared
thee,
thou
pitiless
one
that
restrainest
thy
comrades
at
the
ships,
against
their
will.
Nay,
homewards
let
us
return
again
with
our
seafaring
ships,
since
such
an
evil
wrath
has
sunk
into
thy
heart.'
Even
thus
did
ye
often
clamour
against
me
in
your
gatherings,
but
now
hath
appeared
the
mighty
work
of
war,
wherewith
in
time
past
ye
were
in
love.
Therefore
let
each
man
keep
a
stout
heart
in
the
battle
with
the
Trojans."
So
spake
he,
and
aroused
the
heart
and
valour
of
each
of
them,
and
the
ranks
were
yet
the
closer
serried

but
denied

Then
Achilles,
having
made

to

went
back
into
his
hut,
and
placed
the
cup
in

came
forth
and
stood
in

for
still
his

And

with
a

with

and
spirit
like
theirs
the
Myrmidons
poured
out
now
from
the
ships,
and
a
cry
arose
unquenchable,
and
Patroklos
called
on
his
comrades,
shouting
aloud
:
"
Myrmidons,
ye
comrades
of
Achilles
son
of
Peleus,
be
men,
my
friends,
and
be
mindful
of
your
impetuous
valour,
that
so
we
may
win

for
the

that
is

So
spake
he,

aroused

heart
and
courage,
and
all
in
a
mass
they
fell
on
the
Trojans,

And
Phyleides

where

muscle
is
thickest,
and
the
sinews
were
rent
with
the
point
of
the
spear,
and
darkness
covered
his
eyes.
And
as
for
the
sons
of

one
of

Antilochos,
smote
Atymnios
with
the

drave

rushed

in
wrath
for

stood
in

;
but
godlike
Thrasymedes
was
beforehand
with
him,
and
smote
forward
instantly
at
his
shoulder
ere
he
could
deal
a

and
missed
not,
for
the
point
of
the

rent
the
root

from
the
muscles,
and
tore
it
to
the
bone.
Then
fell
he
with
a
crash,
and
darkness
covered
his
eyes.
So
these
twain,
subdued
by
the
two
brothers,
went
to
Erebos,
even
the
noble
comrades
of
Sarpedon,
the
warrior
sons
of
Amisodaros,
that
reared
the
invincible
Chimaira,
the
bane
of

But
Aias
son
of
Oileus
rushed
on
Cleoboulos,
and
took
him
alive,
entangled
in
the
press
;
so
even
there
he
loosened
his
might,
and
smote
him
on
the
neck
with
the
hilted
sword.
And
all
the
blade
was
warm
with
his
blood,
and
dark
death
closed
his
eyes,
and

Then
Peneleos
and

ran
together,
for
with
their
spears
they
missed
each
other,
yea,
both
had
cast
in
vain,
and
instantly
they
ran
together
with
their

There

smote

at

smote

and

But
Patroklos
followed
after,
crying
fiercely
to
the
Dan-

and
full
of
evil
will
against
the
Trojans,
while
they
with
cries

filled
all

they

on

the

scattered
below
the
clouds,
and
the
whole-hooved
horses
strained
back
towards
the
city,
away
from
the
ships
and
the
huts.
But
even
where
Patroklos
saw
the
folk
thickest
in
the
rout,
thither
did
he
guide
his
horses
with
a
cry,
and
under
his
axle-trees
men
fell
prone
from
their
chariots,
and
the
cars
were
overturned
with
a
din
of
shattering.
But
straight
over
the
ditch,
in
forward
flight,
leaped
the
swift
[immortal]
horses
[that
the
gods
gave
for
glorious
gifts
to
Peleus].
And
the
heart
of
Patroklos
urged
him
against
Hector,
for
he
was
eager
to
smite
him,
but
his
swift
steeds
bore
Hector
forth
and
away.
And
even
as
beneath
a
tempest
the
whole
black
earth
is
oppressed,
on
an
autumn
day,
when
Zeus
pours
forth
rain
most
vehemently,
being
in
wrath
and
anger
against
men,
who
judge
crooked
judgments
forcefully
in
the
assembly,
and
drive

out,

reck
not

and
minished

the

even
so

was
the
roar
of
the
Trojan

as
they
ran.
Now
Patroklos
when
he
had
cloven
the
nearest
companies,
drave
them
backward
again
to
the
ships,
nor
suffered
them
to
approach
the

despite

but
between
the

and

he

heart
within

as
I
ponder
whether

whether

beneath

hands
of
the
son
of

Then
the
ox-eyed
lady
Hera
made
answer
to
him
:
"
Most
dread
son
of
Kronos,
what
word
is
this
thou
hast
spoken
?
A
mortal
man
long
doomed
to
fate
dost
thou
desire
to
delivei
again
from
death
of
evil
name
?
Work
thy
will,
but
all
we
other
gods
will
in
nowise
praise
thee.
And
another
thing
I
will
tell
thee,
and
do
thou
lay
it
up
in
thy
heart
;
if
thou
dost
send
Sarpedon
living
to
his
own
house,
consider
lest
thereon
some
other
god
likewise
desire
to
send
his
own
dear
son
away
out
of
the
strong
battle.
For
round
the
great
citadel
of
Priam
war
many
sons
of
the
Immortals,
and
among
the
Immortals
wilt
thou
send
terrible
wrath.
But
if
he
be
dear
to
thee,
and
thy
heart
mourns
for
him,
truly
then
suffer
him
to
be
subdued
in
the
strong
battle
bem
ith
the
hands
of
Patroklos
son
of
Menoitios,
but
when
his
soul
and
life
leave
that
warrior,
send
Death
and
sweet
Sleep
to
bear
him,
even
till
they
come
to
the
land
of
wide
Lykia,
there
will
his
kin-
dred
and
friends
bury
him,
with
a
barrow
and
a
pillar,
for
this
is
the
due
of
the
dead."
So
spake
she,
nor
did
the
father
of
gods
and
men
dis-
regard
her.
But
he
shed
bloody
raindrops
on
the
earth,
honouring
his
dear
son,
that
Patroklos
was
about
to
slay
in
the
deep-soiled
land
of
Troia,
far
off
from
his
own
country.
Now
when
they
were
come
near
each
other
in
onset,
there
verily
did
Patroklos
smite
the
renowned
Thrasymelos,
the
good
squire
of
the
prince
Sarpedon,
on
the
lower
part
of
the
belly,
and
loosened
his
limbs.
But
Sarpedon
missed
him
with
his
shining
javelin,
as
he
in
turn
rushed
on,
but
wounded
the
horse
Pedasos
on
the
right
shoulder
with
the
spear,
and
he
shrieked
as
he
breathed
his
life
away,

fell
crying
in
the
dust,
and
his
spirit
fled
from
him.
|
the
other
twain
reared
this
way
and
that,
a--.d
th
creaked,
and
the
reins
were
confused
on
them,
when
t
trace-horse
lay
in
the
dust.
But
thereof
did
Aul
the
spearman
renowned,
find
a
remedy,
and
drawing
his
long-edged
sword
from
his
stout
thigh,
he
leaped
forth,
and
cut
adrift
the
horse,
with
no
delay,
and
the
pair
righted
themselves,
and
strained
in
the
reins,
and
they
met
ag.
;n
in
life-devouring
war.
Then
again
Sarpedon
missed
with
his
shining
dart,
and
the
point
of
the
spear
flew
over
the
left
shoulder
of
•
and
smote
him
not,
but
he
in
turn
arose
with
the
l&gt;n&gt;:
and
his
javelin
flew
not
vainly
from
his
hand,
but
Sarpedon
even
where
the
midriff
clasps
the
beating
heart.
And
he
fell
as
falls
an
oak,
or
a
silver
poplar,
or
a
slim
pine
tree,
that
on
the
hills
the
shipwrights
fell
with

to

even
so
before
the
and
chariot
he
lay
at
length,
moaning
aloud,
and
•
ing
at
the
bloody
dust.
And

even
so
under

did
the
leader
of
the
Lykian
shieldmen
rage,
even
in
death,
;
he
called
to
his
dear
comrade:

ILIAD

502-533.
Even
as
he
spake
thus,
the
end
of
death
veiled
over
his
eyes
and
his
nostrils,
but
Patroklos,
setting
foot
on
his
breast,
drew
the
spear
out
of
his
flesh,
and
the
midriff
followed
with
the
spear,
so
that
he
drew
forth
together
the
spear
point,
and
the
soul
of
Sarpedon
;
and
the
Myrmidons
held
there
his
panting
steeds,
eager
to
fly
afar,
since
the
chariot
was
reft
of
its
lords.
Then
dread
sorrow
came
on
Glaukos,
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
Sarpedon,
and
his
heart
was
stirred,
that
he
availed
not
to
succour
him.
And
with
his
hand
he
caught
and
held
his
arm,
for
the
wound
galled
him,
the
wound
of
the
arrow
wherewith,
as
he
pressed
on
to-
wards
the
lofty
wall,
Teukros
had
smitten
him,
warding
off
destruction
from
his
fellows.
Then
in
prayer
spake
Glaukos
to
far
-darting
Apollo
:
"
Hear,
O
Prince
that
art
somewhere
in
the
rich
land
of
Lykia,
or
in
Troia,
for
thou
canst
listen
everywhere
to
the
man
that
is
in
need,
as
even
now
need
cometh
upon
me.
For
I
have
this
stark
wound,
and
mine
arm
is
throughly
pierced
with
sharp
pains,
nor
can
my
blood
be
stanched,
and
by
the
wound
is
my
shoulder
burdened,
and
I
cannot
hold
my
spear
firm,
nor
go
and
fight
against
the
enemy.
And
the
best
of
men
has
perished,
Sarpedon,
the
son
of
Zeus,
and
he
succours
not
even
his
own
child.
But
do
thou,
O
Prince,
heal
me
this
stark
wound,
and
lull
my
pains,
and
give
me
strength,
that
I
may
call
on
my
Lykian
kinsmen,
and
spur
them
to
the
war,
and
myself
may
fight
about
the
dead
man
fallen."
So
spake
he
in
his
prayer,
and
Phoebus
Apollo
heard
him.
Straightway
he
made
his
pains
to
cease,
and
in
the
grievous
wound
stanched
the
black
blood,
and
put
courage
into
his
heart.
And
Glaukos
knew
it
within
him,
and
was
glad,
for
that
the
great
god
speedily
heard
his
prayer.
First
went
he

above
the
strong
battle,
that
round
his
dear
son
might
be
the
woful
toil
of
war.
Now
first
the
Trojans
drove
back
the
bright-eyed
Achaians,
for
a
man
in
no
wise
the
worst
among
the
Myrmidons
was
smitten,
the
son
of
great-hearted
Agakles,
goodly
Epeigeus,
who
ruled
fair-set
Boudeion
of
old,
but
when
he
had
slain
a
good
man
of
his
kin,
to
Peleus
he
came
as
a
suppliant,
and
to
silver-footed
Thetis.
And
they
sent
him
to
follow
with
Achilles,
the
breaker
of
the
ranks
of
men,
to
Ilios
of
the
goodly
steeds,
to
war
with
the
Trojans.
Then
him,
as
he
was
laying
hold
of
the
dead
man,
did
renowned
Hector
smite
on
the
head
with
a
stone,
and
all
his
head
was
broken
in
twain
within
the
strong
helm,
and
prone
on
the
dead
he
fell,
and
round
him
was
poured
death
that
slayeth
the
spirit.
Then
grief
came
on
Patroklos
for
his
comrade
slain,
and
he
rushed
through
the
foremost
fighters,
like
to
a
falcon
swift
of
flight,
that
scareth
daws
and
starlings,
even
so
against
the
Lykians,
O
Patroklos,
warrior
-
charioteer,
and
against
the
Trojans
didst
thou
rush,
being
wroth
at
heart
for
thy
comrade's
sake.
And
he
smote
Sthenelaos,
the
dear
son
of
Ithaimenes,
on
the
neck,
with
a
stone,
and
brake
away
his
sinews.
Then
back
drew
the
foremost
fighters,
and
renowned
Hector.
And
as
far
as
is
the
flight
of
a
long
javelin,
that
a
man
casts,
making
trial
of
his
skill,
either
in
a
contest
for
a
prize,
or
in
war,
being
pressed
by
deadly
foemen,
so
far
did
the
Trojans
draw
back,
and
the
Achaians
drave
them.
And
Glaukos
first,
the
leader
of
the
Lykian
shieldmen,
turned
him
about,
and
slew
Bathykles

the
dear
son
of
Chalkon,
that
dwelt
in
his
home
in
Hellas,
and
for

was
pre-eminent
among
the
Myrmidons.

So
spake
he,

did
the

a
man
of
valour
?
O
my
friend,
not
for
railing
words
will
the
Trojans
draw
back
from
the
dead,
the
earth
must
hold
some
fast
ere
that
may
be.
For
in
the
hands
of
men
is
the
end
of
war,
but
of
words
the
end
is
in
council,
wherefore
in
no
wise
should
we
multiply
words,
but
do
battle."
So
speaking,
he
began,
and
the
other
followed
him,
a
godlike
man.
And
as
the
din
ariseth
of
woodcutters
in
the
glades
of
a
mountain,
and
the
sound
thereof
is
heard
far
away,
so
rose
the
din
of
them
from
the
wide-wayed
earth,
the
noise
of
bronze
and
of
well-tanned
bulls'
hides
smitten
with
swords
and
double-pointed
spears.
And
now
not
even
a
clear-sighted
man
could
any
longer
have
known
noble
Sar-
pedon,
for
with
darts
and
blood
and
dust
was
he
covered
wholly
from
head
to
foot.
And
ever
men
thronged
about
the
dead,
as
in
a
steading
flies
buzz
around
the
full
milk-pails,
in
the
season
of
spring,
when
the
milk
drenches
the
bowls,
even
so
thronged
they
about
the
dead.
Nor
ever
did
Zeus
turn
from
the
strong
fight
his
shining
eyes,
but
ever
looked
down
on
them,
and
much
in
his
heart
he
debated
of
the
slaying
of
Patroklos,
whether
there
and
then
above
divine
Sarpedon
glorious
Hector
should
slay
him
likewise
in
strong
battle
with
the
sword,
and
strip
his
harness
from
his
shoulders,
or
whether
to
more
men
yet
he
should
deal
sheer
labour
of
war.
And
thus
to
him
as
he
pondered
it
seemed
the
better
way,
that
the
gallant
squire
of
Achilles,
Peleus'
son,
should
straightway
drive
the
Trojans
and
Hector
of
the
helm
of
bronze
towards
the
city,
and
should
rob
many
of
their
life.
And
in
Hector
first
he
put
a
weakling
heart,
and
leaping
into
his
car
Hector
turned
in
flight,
and
cried
on
the
rest
of
the
Trojans
to
flee,
for
he
knew
the
turning
of
the
sacred
scales
of
Zeus.
Thereon
neither
did
the
strong
Lykians
abide,
but
fled
all
in
fear,
when
they
beheld
their
king
stricken
to
the
heart
lying
in

the

Then
Zeus

to
Apollo

these
he

but
the
others
were
each
man

fain

Then
would

sons
of
the
Achaians
have
taken

Troy,
by

hands
of
Patroklos,
for
around

before
him
he
raged
with
the

that
Phoebus
Apollo
stood
on
the
well-builded
wall,
with
baneful
thoughts
towards
Patroklos,
and
succouring
the
Trojans.
Thrice
clomb
Patroklos
on
the
corner
of
the
lofty
wall,
and
thrice
did
Apollo
force
him
back
and
smote
the
shining
shield
with
his
immortal
hands.
But
when
for
the
fourth
time
he
came
on
like
a
god,
then
cried
far-darting
Apollo
terribly,
and
spake
winged
words
:
"
Give
back,
Patroklos
of
the
seed
of
Zeus
!
Not
beneath
thy
spear
is
it
fated
that
the
city
of
the
valiant
Trojans
shall
fall,
nay
ner
beneath
Achilles,
a
man
far
bettei
than
thou."
So
spake
he,
and
Patroklos
retreated
far
back,
avoiding
the
wrath
of
far-darting
Apollo.
But
Hector
within
the
Skaian
gates
was
restraining
his
whole-hooved
horses,
pon-
dering
whether
he
should
drive
again
into
the
din
and
fight,
or
should
call
unto
the
host
to
gather
to
the
wall.
While
thus
he
was
thinking,
Phoebus
Apollo
stood
by
him
in
the
guise
of
a
young
man
and
a
strong,
Asios,
who
was
the
mother's
brother
of
horse
-taming
Hector,
being
own
brother
of
Hekabe,
and
son
of
Dymas,
who
dwelt
in
Phrygia,
on
the
streams
of
Sangarios.
In
his
guise
spake
Apollo,
son
of
Zeus,
to
Hector
:
"
Hector,
wherefore
dost
thou
cease
from
fight
?
It
doth
not
behove
thee.
Would
that
I
were
as
much
stronger
than
thou
as
I
am
weaker,
thereon
quickly
shouldst
thou
stand
aloof
from
war
to
thy
hurt.
But
come,
turn
against
Patroklos
thy
strong-hooved
horses,
if
perchance
thou
mayst
slay
him,
and
Apollo
give
thee
glory."
So
spake
the
god,
and
went
back
again
into
the
moil
of
men.
But

Hector

Hector
then
seized
him
by
the
head,
and
slackened
not

while
Patroklos
on
the

side
grasped
him
by
the
foot,
and
thereon
the
others,
Trojans

Danaans,
joined
strong
battle.

the
Trojans
and

were
leaping
on

and
slaying,
nor
had
either
side
any

And
many
sharp

were
fixed
around
Kebriones,
and
winged
arrows
leaping
from

and
many
mighty
stones
smote
the

that
fought
around

But
he
in

lay
mighty
and

Now

lo,

The

drew

forth

out

the
Trojans,
and
stripped
the

persuaded

Then
faintly
didst
thou
answer
him,
knightly
Patroklos
:
"

BOOK
XVII.
Of
the
battle
around
the
body
of
Patroklos.
BUT
Atreus'
son,
Menelaos
dear
to
Ares,
was
not
unaware
of
the
slaying
of
Patroklos
by
the
Trojans
in
the
fray.
He
went
up
through
the
front
of
the
fight
harnessed
in
flashing
bronze,
and
strode
over
the
body
as
above
a
first-born
calf
standeth
lowing
its
mother,
ere
then
unused
to
motherhood.
Thus
above
Patroklos
strode
fair-haired
Menelaos,
and
be-
fore
him
held
his
spear
and
the
circle
of
his
shield,
eager
to
slay
whoever
should
encounter
him.
Then
was
Panthoos'
son
of
the
stout
ashen
spear
not
heedless
of
noble
Patroklos
as
he
lay,
and
he
stood
anigh
him
and
spake
to
Menelaos
dear
to
Ares
:
"
Atreus'
son
Menelaos,
Zeus-fostered,
cap-
tain
of
the
host,
give
back
and
leave
the
body
and
yield
the
bloody
spoils
;
for
before
me
was
there
none
of
the
Trojans
and
their
famed
allies
who
smote
Patroklos
with
the
spear
in
the
stress
of
fight
;
wherefore
yield
me
this
fair
glory
to
win
among
the
Trojans,
lest
I
hurl
and
smite
thee,
and
bereave
thee
of
sweet
life."
Then
sorely
wroth
spake
unto
him
fair
-haired
Mene-

:
"

Thus
he

he

to
him
in

the

it

a
goodly
shoot
fair-growing;
and
blasts
of

winds
shake
it,
yet
it
bursteth
into

;
then
suddenly
cometh
the
wind
of
a
great
hurricane
and
wresteth
it
out
of
its
abiding
place
and
stretcheth
it
out
upon
the
earth
:
even
so
lay
Panthoos'
son
Euphorbos
of
the
good
ashen
spear
when
Menelaos
Atreus'
son
had
slain
him,
and
despoiled
him
of
his
arms.
Now
as
when
some
mountain-bred
lion,
trusting
in
his
might,
hath
seized
the
best
heifer
out
of
a
feeding
herd,
and
first
taketh
her
neck
in
his
strong
teeth
and
breaketh
it,
and
then
devoureth
fiercely
the
blood
and
all
the
inward
parts,
while
around
him
hounds
and
herdsmen
clamour
loudly
afar
off
yet
will
not
come
up
against
him,
for
pale
fear
taketh
hold
on
them,
—
even
so
dared
not
the
heart
in
the
breast
of
any
Trojan
to
come
up
against
glorious
Menelaos.
Then
easily
would
the
son
of
Atreus
have
borne
off
the
noble
spoils
of
Panthoos'
son,
had
not
Phoebus
Apollo
grudged
it
him,
and
aroused
against
him
Hector
peer
of
swift
Ares,
putting
on
the
semblance
of
a
man,
of
Mentes
chief
of
the
Kikones.
And
he
spake
aloud
to
him
winged
words
:
"
Hector,
now
art
thou
hasting
after
things
unattain-
able,
even
the
horses
of

Aiakides
;
for
hard
are
they
to
be
tamed
or
driven
by

man,
save
only
Achilles
whom
an
immortal
mother
bare.
Meanwhile
hath
warlike
Menelaos
Atreus'
son
stridden
over
Patroklos
and
slain
the
best
of
the
Trojans
there,
even
Panthoos'
son
Euphorbos,
and
hath
stayed
him
in
his
impetuous
might."
Thus
saying
the
god
went
back
into
the
strife
of
men,
but
dire
grief
darkened
Hector's
inmost
soul,
and
then
he
gazed
searchingly
along
the
lines,
and
straightway
was
aware
of
the
one
man
stripping
off
the
noble
arms,
and
the
other
lying
on
the
earth
;
and
blood
was
flowing
about
the
gaping
wound.
Then
he
went
through
the
front
of
the
fight
harnessed
in
xvn,
87-120,

crying
a

cry,

Not

to

was
A
t
;
son,
and
sore
troubled
he
spake
to
his
great
heart
:
"
Ay
me,
if
I
shall
leave
behind
me
these
goodly
arms,
and
Patroklos
who
here
Heth
for
my
vengeance'
sake,
I
fear
some
Danaan
beholding
it
be
wroth
against
me.
Um
ii
honour's
sake
I
do
battle
alone
with
Hector
and
the
'1
jans,
I
fear
lest
they
come
about
me
many
against
one
;
for
all
the
Trojans
is
bright-helmed
Hector
leading
hither,
wherefore
thus
debateth
my
heart
?
When
a
man
against
the
power
of
heaven
is
fain
to
fight
with
another
whom
God
exalteth,
then
swiftly
rolleth
on
him
mighty
woe.
Therefore
shall
none
of
the
Danaans
be
wroth
with
me
though
he
be-
hold
me
giving
place
to
Hector,
since
he
warreth
with
gods
upon
his
side.
But
if
I
might
somewhere
find
Aias
of
the
loud
war-cry,
then
both
together
would
we
go
and
be
mindful
of
battle
even
were
it
against
the
power
of
heaven,
if
haply
we
might
save
his
dead
for
Achilles
Peleus'
son
:
that
were
best
among
these
ills."
While
thus
he
communed
with
his
mind
and
heart,
there
withal
the
Trojan
ranks
came
onward,
and
Hector
at
their
head.
Then
Menelaos
gave
backward,
and
left
the
dead
man,
turning
himself
ever
about
like
a
deep-mancd
lion
which
men
and
dogs
chase
from
a
fold
with
spears
and
cries;
and
his
strong
heart
within
him
groweth
chill,
and
loth
goeth
he
from
the
steading;
so
from
Patroklos
went
fair-haired
Menelaos,
and
turned
and
stood,
when
he
&lt;
to
the
host
of
his
comrades,
searching
for
mighty
Aias
Telamon's
son.
Him
very
speedily
he
espied
on
the
left
the
whole
battle,
cheering
his
comrades
and
rousing
tin
fight,
for
great
terror
had
Phoebus
Apollo
sent
on
ihnn
;
and
he
hasted
him
to
run,
and
straightway
stood
by
him
and
said:
"This

beloved
Aias;

dead
Patroklos,
if
haply
his
naked
corpse
at
least
we
may
carry
to
Achilles,
though
his
armour
is
held
by
Hector
of
the
glancing
helm."
Thus
spake
he,
and
aroused
the
heart
of
wise
Aias.
And
he
went
up
through
the
front
of
the
fight,
and
with
him
fair-haired
Menelaos.
Now
Hector,
when
he
had
stripped
from
Patroklos
his
noble
armour,
was
dragging
him
thence
that
he
might
cut
off
the
head
from
the
shoulders
with
the
keen
bronze
and
carry
his
body
to
give
to
the
dogs
of
Troy.
But
Aias
came
anigh,
and
the
shield
that
he
bare
was
as
a
tower
;
then
Hector
gave
back
into
the
company
of
his
comrades,
and
sprang
into
his
chariot;
and
the
goodly
armour
he
gave
to
the
Trojans
to
carry
to
the
city,
to
be
great
glory
unto
him.
But
Aias
spread
his
broad
shield
over
the
son
of
Menoitios
and
stood
as
it
were
a
lion
before
his
whelps
when
huntsmen
in
a
forest
encounter
him
as
he
leadeth
his
young
—
then
waxeth
he
in
his
strength,
and
draweth
down
all
his
brows
to
cover
his
eyes
:
—
so
over
the
hero
Patroklos
Aias
strode.
And
by
his
side
stood
Atreus'
son,
Menelaos
dear
to
Ares,
nursing
great
sorrow
in
his
breast.
Then
Glaukos,
Hippolochos'
son,
chief
of
the
men
of
Lykia,
looked
toward
Hector
with
a
frown
and
chode
him
with
rough
words
:
"
Hector,

lo,
in

art

for

at

shall
none
go
up
to
fight
against
the
Danaans
for
the
city's
sake,
since
no
boon,
it
seemeth,
is
it
to
fight
unsparingly
ever
against
men
of
war.
How
art

to

unto

348
ILIAD

Thus
saying
he
called
on
the
Trojans
with
a
mighty
shout
:
"
Trojans
and
Lykians
and
Dardanians
that
fight
hand
to
hand,
be
men,
my
friends,
and
bethink
you
of
impe-

until
I
do
on
me
the
goodly
arms
of
noble
Achilles
that
I
stripped
from
brave
Patroklos
when
I
slew
him."
Thus
having
spoken
went
Hector
of
the
glancing
helm
forth
out
of
the
strife
of
war,
and
ran
and
speedily
with
fleet
feet
following
overtook
his
comrades,
not
yet
far
off,
who
were
bearing
to
the
city
Peleides'
glorious
arms.
And
standing
apart
from
the
dolorous
battle
he
changed
his
armour
;
his
own
he
gave
the
warlike
Trojans
to
carry
to
sacred
Ilios,
and
he
put
on
the
divine
arms
of
Achilles,
Peleus'
son,
which
to
his
dear
father
the
gods
who
inhabit
heaven
gave,
and
Peleus
committed
them
unto
his
child
when
old
him-
self
;
but
never
in
his
father's
armour
did
that
son
grow
old.
But
when
Zeus
that
gathereth
the
clouds
beheld
from
afar
off
Hector
arming
him
in
the
armour
of
Peleus'
godlike
son,
he
shook
his
head
and
spake
thus
unto
his
soul
:
"
Ah,
hapless
man,
no
thought
is
in
thy
heart
of
death
that
yet
draweth
nigh
unto
thee
;
thou
doest
on
thee
the
divine
armour
of
a
peerless
man
before
whom
the
rest
have
terror.
His
comrade,
gentle
and
brave,
thou
hast
slain,
and
un-
meetly
hast
stripped
the
armour
from
his
head
and
shoulders;
yet
now
for
a
while
at
least
I
will
give
into
thy
hands
great
might,
in
recompense
for
this,
even
that
no
wise
shalt
thou
come
home
out
of
the
battle,
for
Andromache
to
receive
from
thee
Peleides'
glorious
arms."
Thus
spake
the
son
of
Kronos
and
bowed
his
dark
brows
therewithal.
But
the
armour
fitted
itself
unto
Hector's
body,
and
Ares
the
dread
war-god
entered
into
him,
and
his
limbs
were
filled
within
with
valour
and
strength.
Then
he
sped

regarded
him
not,
but
shouted
unto
the
Danaans,
crying
a
far-heard
cry
:
"
O

ye

and

of
the
Argives,
who

side

of

is
it
for

—

blaze
is
there
of
the
strife
of

But
let
each
go
forward
of
himself
and
be
wroth
at
heart
that
Patroklos
should
become
a
sport
among
the
dogs
of
Troy."
Thus
spake
he,
and
Oileus'
son
fleet
Aias
heard
him
clearly,
and
was
first
to
run
along
the
mellay
to
meet
him,
and
after
him
Idomeneus,
and
Idomeneus'
brother-in-arms,
Meriones,
peer
of
the
man-slaying
war-god.
And
who
shall
of
his
own
thought
tell
the
names
of
the
rest,
even
of
all
that
after
these
aroused
the
battle
of
the
Achaians
?
Now
the
Trojans
charged
forward
in
close
array,
and
Hector
led
them.
And
as
when
at
the
mouth
of
some
heaven-born
river
a
mighty
wave
roareth
against
the
stream,
and
arouseth
the
high
cliffs'
echo
as
the
salt
sea
belloweth
on
the
beach,
so
loud
was
the
cry
wherewith
the
Trojans
came.
But
the
Achaians
stood
firm
around
Menoitios'
son
with
one
soul
all,
walled
in
with
shields
of
bronze.
And
over
their
bright
helmets
the
son
of
Kronos
shed
thick
darkness,
for
in
the
former
time
was
Menoitios'
son
not
unloved
of
him,
while
he
was
yet
alive
and
squire
of
Aiakides.
So
was
Zeus
loth
that
he
should
become
a
prey
of
the
dogs
of
his
enemies
at
Troy,
and
stirred
his
comrades
to
do
battle
for
him.
Now
first
the
Trojans
thrust
back
the
glancing
-eyed
Achaians,
who
shrank
before
them
and
left
the
dead,
yet
the
proud
Trojans
slew
not
any
of
them
with
spears,
though
they
were
fain,
but
set
to

aloud
and
haled

and
did
off
the
armour
from

Then
would
the
Trojans
in
their
turn
in
their
weakness
overcome
have
been
driven
back
into

by

to

and
the
Argives
would
have
won
glory
even
against

of

their
power
and

But
Apollo
himself
aroused
Aineias,
putting
on
the
semblance
of
Periphas
the
herald,
the
son
of
Epytos,
who
grew
old
with
his
old
father
in
his
heraldship,
of
friendly
thought
toward
Aineias.
In
his
similitude
spake
Apollo,
son
of
Zeus
'.
"Aineias,
how
could
ye
ever
guard
high
Ilios
if
it
were
against
the
will
of
God
?
Other
men
have
I
seen
that
trust
in
their
own
might
and
power
and
valour,
and
in
their
host,
even
though
they
have
scant1
folk
to
lead.
But
here,
albeit
Zeus
is
fainer
far
to
give
victory
to
us
than
to
the
Danaans,
yet
ye
are
dismayed
exceedingly
and
fight
not."
Thus
spake
he,
and
Aineias
knew
far-darting
Apollo
when
he
looked
upon
his
face,
and
spake
unto
Hector,
shouting
loud
:

And

warlike

made
onward
full

to
do

against
the
I

that
could

no

for
they
were
fenced
on
every
side
with
shields
as
they
stood
around
Patroklos,
and
held
their
spears
in
front
of
them.
For
Aias
ranged
through
them
all
and
called
on
them
now

again,
and
bade
that
none

the
Achaians

but
keep

Thus
mighty
Aias
commanded,
and
the
earth
was
wet

the

all

were

Yet
two

day
long
waxed
the
mighty
fray
of
their
sore
strife,
and
unabatingly
ever
with
the
sweat
of
toil
were
the
knees
and
legs
and
feet
of
each
man
and
arms
and
eyes
bedewed
as
the
two
hosts
did
battle
around
the
brave
squire
of
fleet
Aiakides.
And
as
when
a
man
giveth
the
hide
of
a
great
bull
to
his
folk
to
stretch,
all
soaked
in
fat,
and
they
take
and
stretch
it
standing
in
a
circle,
and
straightway
the
moisture
thereof
departeth
and
the
fat
entereth
in
under
the
haling
of
many
hands,
and
it
is
all
stretched
throughout,
—
thus
they
on
both
sides
haled
the
dead
man
this
way
and
that
in
narrow
space,
for
their
hearts
were
high
of
hope,
the
Trojans
that
they
should
drag
him
to
Ilios
and
the
Achaians
to
the
hollow
ships
;
and
around
him
the
fray
waxed
wild,
nor
might
Ares
rouser
of
hosts
nor
Athene
despise
the
sight
thereof,
albeit
their
anger
were
exceeding
great.
Such
was
the
grievous
travail
of
men
and
horses
over
Patroklos
that
Zeus
on
that
day
wrought.
But
not
as
yet
knew
noble
Achilles
aught
of
Patroklos'
death,
for
far
away
from
the
swift
ships
they
were
fighting
beneath
the
wall
of
the
men
of
Troy.
Therefore
never
deemed
he
in
his
heart
that
he
was
dead,
but
that
he
should
come
back
alive,
after
that
he
had
touched
the
gates
;
for
neither
that
other
thought
had
he
anywise,
that
Patroklos
should

Thus
would

speak,
and
rouse
the
spirit
of
each.
So
they
fought

the

beside

And
when
the
son
of
Kronos
beheld
them
mourning
he
had
compassion
on
them,
and
shook
his
head
and
spake
to
his
own
heart
:
"
Ah,
hapless
pair,
why
gave
we
you
to
king
Peleus,
a
mortal
man,
while
ye
are
deathless
and
ever
young
?
Was
it
that
ye
should
suffer
sorrows
among
ill-fated
men
?
For
methinketh
there
is
nothing
more
piteous
than
a
man
among
all
things
that
breathe
and
creep
upon
the
earth.
But
verily
Hector
Priam's
son
shall
not
drive
you
and
your
deftly
-wrought
car;
that
will
I
not
suffer.
Is
it
a
small
thing
that
he
holdeth
the
armour
and
vaunteth
himself
vainly
thereupon
?
Nay,
I
will
put
courage
into
your
knees
and
heart
that

For
yet
further
will
I
increase

to
the
men
of

so
that
they
slay
until
they
come
unto
the
well-timbered
ships,
and
the
sun
set
and
divine
night
come
down."
Thus
saying
he
breathed
good
courage
into
the
horses.
And
they
shook
to
earth
the
dust
from
their
manes,
and
lightly
bare
the
swift
car
amid
Trojans
and
Achaians.
And
behind
them
fought
Automedon,
albeit
in
grief
for
his
com-
rade,
swooping
with
his
chariot
as
a
vulture
on
wild
geese
;
for
lightly
he
would
flee
out
of
the
onset
of
the
Trojans
and
lightly
charge,
pursuing
them
through
the
thick
mellay.
Yet
could
he
not
slay
any
man
as
he
hasted
to
pursue
them,
for
it
was
impossible
that
being
alone
in
his
sacred
car
he
should
at
once
assa.i
them
with
the
spear
and
hold
his
fleet
horses.
Then
at
last
espied
him
a
comrade,
even
Alkimedon
son
of
Laerkes,
son
of
Haimon,
and
he
halted
behind
the
car
and
spake
unto
Automedon
:
"

And

unto

358
TLIAD
XVII,
507-540.
Thus
said
he,
and
called
upon
the
Aiantes
and
Menelaos
:
"
Aiantes,
leaders
of
the
Argives,
and
Menelaos,
lo
now,
commit
ye
the
corpse
unto
whoso
may
best
avail

it
and
resist
the
ranks
of
men,
and
come
ye
to

day
of

from

who

alive,
for
here
in
the
dolorous
war
are
Hector
and
Aineias,
the
best
men
of
the
Trojans,
pressing
hard.
Yet
verily
these
issues
lie
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
:
I
too
will
cast
my
spear,
and
the
rest
shall
Zeus
decide."
He
said,
and
poised
his
far-shadowing
spear
and
hurled
it,
and
smote
on
the
circle
of
the
shield
of
Aretos,
and
the
shield
sustained
not
the
spear,
but
right
through
went
the
bronze,
and
he
forced
it
into
his
belly
low
down
through
his
belt.
And
as
when
a
strong
man
with
a
sharp
axe
smiting
behind
the
horns
of
an
ox
of
the
homestead
cleaveth
the
sinew
asunder,
and
the
ox
leapeth
forward
and
falleth,
so
leapt
Aretos
forward
and
fell
on
his
back
;
and
the
spear
in
his
entrails
very
piercingly
quivering
unstrung
his
limbs.
And
Hector
hurled
at
Automedon
with
his
bright
spear,
but
he
looked
steadfastly
on
the
bronze
javelin
as
it
came
at
him
and
avoided
it,
for
he
stooped
forward,
and
the
long
spear
fixed
itself
in
the
ground
behind,
and
the
javelin-butt
quivered,
and
there
dread
Ares
took
away
its
force.
And
then
had
they
lashed
at
each
other
with
their
swords
hand
to
hand,
had
not
the
Aiantes
parted
them
in
their
fury,
when
they
were
come
through
the
mellay
at
their
comrade's
call.
Before
them
Hector
and
Aineias
and
godlike
Chromios
shrank
backward
and
gave
ground
and
left
Aretos
wounded
to
the
death
as
he
lay.
And
Automedon,
peer
of
swift
Ares,
stripped
off
the
armour
of
the
dead,
and
spake
exultingly
:
"
Verily,
I
have
a
little
eased
my
heart
of
grief
for
the
death
of
Menoi-
tios'
son,
albeit
a
worse
man
than
him
have
I
slain."
Thus
saying
he
took
up
the
gory
spoils
and
set
them

So
again
above
Patroklos
was
waged
the
violent
fray,
crud
and
woful,
and
Athene
roused
their
strife,
from

de-

for
far-seeing

her
to

First
to
urge
Atreus'

for
he
was
nigh
to

she
spake
to
him,
making
herself

unto

and

voice
:
"Tothee

Then

a
brave,
and
Hector
honoured
him
especially
among
the
people
for
that
he
was
his
dear
comrade
and
boon
companion.
Him
smote
fair-haired
Menelaos
in
the
belt
as
he
started
to
flee,
and
drove
his
spearhead
right
through,
and
he
fell
with
a
crash,
and
Menelaos,
Atreus'
son,
haled
his
body
from
amid
the
Trojans
among
his
comrades'
company.
But
Apollo
came
and
stood
near
Hector
and
aroused
him,
in
the
semblance
of
Asios'
son
Phainops,
who
of
all
guest-
friends
was
dearest
to
him,
and
had
his
home
in
Abydos.
[In
his
likeness
spake
far-
darting
Apollo
unto
Hector]
:
"
Hector,
what
other
of
the
Achaians
will
fear
thee
any
more,
if
now
thou
hast
shrunk
from
Menelaos
who
formerly
was
an
unhardy
warrior
?
Now
is
he
gone
and
alone
hath
seized
a
dead
Trojan
from
among
our
ranks,
and
hath
slain
thy
faithful
comrade,
a
good
man
among
the
fighters
in
the
front,
even
Podes,
son
of
Eetion."
Thus
spake
he,
and
a
black
cloud
of
grief
fell
on
Hector,
and
he
went
through
the
forefront
of
the
battle,
harnessed
in
flashing
bronze.
Then
also
the
son
of
Kronos
took
up
his
tasselled
aegis
glittering,
and
shrouded
Ida
in
clouds,
and
lightened
and
thundered
mightily,
and
shook
the
earth;1
and
he
gave
victory
to
the
Trojans,
and
the
Achaians
he
dismayed.
First
to
set
dismay
on
foot
was
Peneleos
the
Boiotian.
For
he
was
smitten
in
the
shoulder
by
a
javelin
grazingly
on
the
surface,
as
he
kept
ever
his
face
to
the
foe
;
the
spear
point
of
Polydamas
scratched
the
bone,
for
he
cast
it
from
nigh
at

Then
again
Hector
in
close

wounded
Lei'tos
on
the
wrist,
the
son
of
great-hearted
Alektryon,
and
stayed
him
from

and
he
shrank

that

But
nowhere
can
I
behold
such
an
one
among

for

and

likewise
are
wrapped
in

O

deliver
thou
the

from

and
make

vouchsafe

In

be

since
it

Thus

he,
and
the
Father
grieved
to
see
him
weep,
and
straightway
scattered
the
darkness
and
drave
away
the
mist,
and
the
sun
shone
out
on
them,
and
all
the
battle
was
manifest.
Then
spake
Aias
to
Menelaos
of
the
loud
war-
cry
:
"
Look
forth

Menelaos

of

and
rouse

to

to

that

Thus

Menelaos
of

but
he

But
thy

Menelaos

chose
not
to
stay
to
aid
the
wearied
comrades
from
whom
Antilochos
departed,
and
great
sorrow
was
among
the
Pylians.
But
to
them
Mene-

sent
noble
Thrasymedes,
and
himself
went
again
to
be-
stride
the
hero
Patroklos.
And
he
hasted
and
stood
beside
the
Aiantes
and
straightway
spake
to
them
:
"
So
have
I
sent
that
man
to
the

to
go
to
fleet-footed
Achilles.
Yet
deem
I
not
that
he

now
come,
for
all
his
wrath
against

for
he
could
not

against

of

But
let

both
how
we
may
hale

dead
away,
and
how
we
ourselves
may
escape
death
and
fate
amid
the
Trojans'
battle-cry."
Then
answered
him
great
Aias
Telamon's
son,
saying
:
"All
this
hast
thou
said
well,
most
noble
Menelaos.
But
do
thou
and
Meriones
put
your
shoulders
beneath
the
dead
and
lift
him
and
bear
him
swiftly
out
of
the
fray,
while
we
twain
behind
you
shall
do
battle
with
the
Trojans
and
noble
Hector,
one
in
heart
as
we
are
in
name,
for
from
of
old
time
we
are
wont
to
await
fierce
battle
side
by
side."
Thus
spake
he,
and
the
others
took
the
dead
man
in
their
arms
and
lifted
him
mightily
on
high.
But
the
Trojan
host
behind
cried
aloud
when
they
saw
the
Achaians
lifting
the
corpse,

charged

they

Thus

with

and
double-headed

to

he
in

of

ships
of
upright
horns,
boding
in
his
soul
the
things
which
even
now
were
accomplished.
And
sore
troubled
he
spake
to
his
great
heart
:
"Ay
me,

Achaians

to

went
up

his

stood
beside

and
with
a
shrill
cry
clasped
the
head
of
her

and
spake
unto
him
winged
words
of
lamentation
:
"
My
child,
why
weepest
thou
?
what

hath
come
to
thy

?
Tell
it

should

unto

for

Then
Thetis
the
silver-footed
goddess
answered
him
say-
ing
:
"
Yea
verily,
my
child,
no

is
in
this,
that

thy

beareth
it

in

I

for

But
thou

In
the
morning
will
I
return,
at
the
coming
up
of
the
sun,
bearing
fair
armour
from
the
king
Hephaistos."
Thus
spake
-,he
and
turned
to
go
from
her
son,
and
as
she
turned
she
spake
among
her
sisters
of
the
sea
:
"
Ye
now
go
down
within
the
wide
bosom
of
the
deep,
to
visit
the
Ancient
One
of
the
Sea
and
our
father's
house,
and
tell
him
all.
I
am
going
to
high
Olympus
to
Hephaistos
of
noble
skill,
if
haply
he
will
give
unto
my
son
noble
armour
shin-
ing
gloriously."
Thus
spake
she,
and
they
forthwith
went
down
beneath
the
surge
of
the
sea.
And
the
silver-footed
goddess
Thetis
went
on
to
Olympus
that
she
might
bring
noble
armour
to
her
son.
So
her
unto
Olympus
her
feet
bore.
But
the
Achaians
with
terrible
cries
were
fleeing
before
man-slaying
Hector
till
they
came
to
the
ships
and
to
the
Hellespont.
Nor
might

my

Then
again
spake
unto
him
wind-footed
fleet
Iris
:
"
Well
are
we
also
aware
that
thy

armour
is
held
from
thee.
But
go
forth
unto
the
trench
as
thou
art
and
show
thyself
to
the
men
of

if
haply
they
will
shrink

them

and
the

for

Thus
spake
fleet-footed
Iris
and
went
her
way.
But
Achilles
dear
to
Zeus
arose,
and
around
his
strong
shoulders
Athene
cast
her
tasselled
aegis,
and
around
his
head
the
bright
goddess
set
a
crown
of
a
golden
cloud,
and
kindled
therefrom
a
blazing
flame.
And
as
when
a
smoke
issueth
from
a
city
and
riseth
up
into
the
upper
air,
from
an
island
afar
off

if
haply
they
may

—
thus
from
the
head
of
Achilles
soared
that
blaze
toward
the
heavens.
And
he
went
and
stood
beyond
the
wall
beside
the
trench,
yet
mingled
not
among
the
Achaians,
for
he
minded
the
wise
bidding
of
his

There
stood
he
and
shouted
aloud,
and
afar

Pallas

uttered

and
spread

men

with
the
spear.
So
with
good
intent
toward
them
he
made
harangue
and
spake
:
"
Take
good
heed
on
both
sides,
O
my
friends
;
for
my
part
I
would
have
ye
go
up
now
to
the
city,
not
wait
for
bright
morning
on
the
plain
beside
the
ships,
for
we
are
far
off
from
the
wall.
So
long
as
this
man
was
wroth
with
noble
Agamemnon,
so
long
were
the
Achaians
easier
to
fight
against,
ay
and
I
too
rejoiced
when
I
couched
nigh
their
swift
ships,
trusting
that
we
should
seize
the
curved
ships
for
a
prey.
But
now
am
I
sore
afraid
of
the
fleet
son
of
Peleus
;
so
exceeding
fierce
is
his
heart,
he
will
not
choose
to
abide
in
the
plain
where
Trojans
and
Achaians
both
in
the
midst
share
the
spirit
of
war,
but
the
prize
he
doeth
battle
for
will
be
our
city
and
our
wives.
Now
go
we
up
to
our
fast-
ness
;
hearken
unto
me,
for
thus
will
it
be.
Now
hath
divine
night
stayed
the
fleet
son
of
Peleus,
but
if
to-morrow
full-
armed
for
the
onset
he
shall
light
upon
us
abiding
here,
well
shall
each
know
that
it
is
he,
for
gladly
will
whosoever
fleeth
win
to
sacred
Ilios,
and
many
of
the
men
of
Troy
shall
dogs
and
vultures
devour
—
far
be
that
from
my
ear.
But
if,
though
loth,
we
hearken
unto
my
words,
this
night
in
counsel
we
shall
possess
our
strength,
and
the
city
shall
be
guarded
of
her
towers
and
high
gates
and
tall
well-polished
doors
that
fit
thereon
close-shut.
But
at
dawn
of
day
in
armour
harnessed
will
we
take
our
stand
along
the
towers.
Ill
will
he
fare
if
he
come
forth
from
the
ships
to
fight
with
us
for
our
wall.
Back
to
his
ships
shall
he
betake
him
when
in
vain
chase
he
hath
given
his
strong-necked
horses
their
fill
of
hasting
everywhither
beneath
the
town.
But
within
it
never
will
he
have
heart
to
force
his
way,
nor
ever
lay
it
waste;
ere
then
shall
he
be
devoured
of
swift
dogs."
Then
with
stern
gaze
spake
unto
him
Hector
of
the
glancing
helm
:
"

—
thus
Achilles
moaning
heavily
spake
among
the
Myrmidons
:
"Ay

was
the
word
I
uttered
on
that
day
when
I
cheered
the
hero
Menoitios
in
his
halls
and
said
that
I
would
bring
back
to
Opoeis
his
son
in
glory
from
the
sack
of
Ilios
with
the
share
of
spoil
that
should
fall
unto
him.
Not
all
the
pur-
poses
of
men
doth
Zeus
accomplish
for
them.
It
is
ap-
pointed
that
both
of
us
redden
the
same
earth
with
our
blood
here
in
Troy-land,
for
neither
shall
the
old
knight
Peleus
welcome
me
back
home
within
his
halls,
nor
my
mother
Thetis,
but
even
here
shall
earth
keep
hold
on
me.
Yet
now,
O
Patroklos,
since
I
follow
thee
under
earth,
I
will
not
hold
thy
funeral
till
I
have
brought
hither
the
armour
and
the
head
of
Hector,
thy
high-hearted
slayer,1
and
before
thy
pyre
I
will
cut
the
throats
of
twelve
noble
sons
of
the
men
of
Troy,
for
mine
anger
thou
art
slain.
Till
then
beside
the

she

"

Thus
spake
the
bright
goddess
and
led
her
on.
Then
set
she
her
on
a
silver-studded
throne,
goodly,
of
cunning
work,
and
a
footstool
was
beneath

;
and
she
called
to

the

and
said
unto
him
:
"
Hephaistos,

hither,

And
the
renowned
lame
god
made
answer
to
her:
"Verily

Then

the

nor
suffered
them
to

forth.
And
the
elders
of
the
Argives
entreated
him,
and
told
over
many
noble
gifts.
Then
albeit
himself
he
refused
to
ward
destruction
from
them,
he
put
his
armour
on
Patroklos
and
sent
him
to
the
v,ar,
and
much
people
with
him.
All
day
they
fought
around
the
Skaian
gates
and
that
same
day
had
sacked
the
town,
but
that
when
now
Menoitios'
valiant
son
had
wrought
much
harm,
Apollo
slew
him
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle,
and
gave
glory
unto
Hector.
Therefore
now
come
I
a
suppliant
unto
thy
knees,
if
haply
thou
be
willing
to
give
my
short-lived
son
shield
and
helmet,
and
goodly
greaves
fitted
with
ankle-pieces,
and
cuirass.
For
the
armour
that
he
had
erst,
his
trusty
comrade
lost
when
he
fell
beneath
the
men
of
Troy;
and
my
son
lieth
on
the
earth
with
anguish
in
his
soul."
Then
made
answer
unto
her
the
lame
god
of
great
renown
:
"
Be
of
good
courage,
let
not
these
things
trouble
thy
heart.
Would
that
so
might
I
avail
to
hide
him
far
from
dolorous
death,
when
dread
fate
cometh
upon
him,
as
surely
shall
goodly
armour
be
at
his
need,
such
as
all
men
afterward
shall
marvel
at,
whosoever
may
behold."
Thus
saying
he
left
her
there
and
went
unto
his
bellows
and
turned
them
upon
the
fire
and
bade
them
work.
And
the
bellows,
twenty
in
all,
blew
on
the
crucibles,
sending
deft
blasts
on
every
side,
now
to
aid
his
labour
and
now

howsoever
Hephaistos
willed
and
the
work
went
on.
And
he
threw

fire,
and
tin
and

and

and
next
he
set

even
whatsoever
substance
the
fair
city
held
within.
But
the
besieged
were
not
yet
yielding,
but
arming
for
an
ambushment.
On
the
wall
there
stood
to
guard
it
their
dear
wives
and
infant
children,
and
with
these
the
old
men
;
but
the
rest
went
forth,
and
their
leaders
were
Ares
and
Pallas
Athene,
both
wrought
in
gold,
and
golden
was
the
vesture
they
had
on.
Goodly
and
great
were
they
in
their
armour,
even
as
gods,
far
seen
around,
and
the
folk
at
their
feet
were
smaller.
And
when
they
came
where
it
seemed
good
to
them
to
lay
ambush,
in
a
river
bed
where
there
was
a
common
watering-place
of
herds,
there
they
set
them,
clad
in
glitter-
ing
bronze.
And
two
scouts
were
posted
by
them
afar
off
to
spy
the
coming
of
flocks
and
of
oxen
with
crooked
horns.
And
presently
came
the
cattle,
and
with
them
two
herdsmen
playing
on
pipes,
that
took
no
thought
of
the
guile.
Then
the
others
when
they
beheld
these
ran
upon
them
and
quickly
cut
off
the
herds
of
oxen
and
fair
flocks
of
white
sheep,
and
slew
the
shepherds
withal.
But
the
besiegers,
as
they
sat
before
the
speech-places8
and
heard
much
din
among
the
oxen,
mounted
forthwith
behind
their
high-stepping
horses,
and
came
up
with
speed.
Then
they
arrayed
their
battle
and
fought
beside
th

banks,
and
smote
one
another
with
bronze-shod
spears.
And
among
them
mingled
Strife
and
Tumult,
and
fell
Death,
grasping
one
man
alive
fresh-
wounded,
another
without
wound,
and
dragging
another
dead
through
the
mellay
by
the
feet
;
and
the
raiment
on
her
shoulders
was
red
with
the
blood
of
men.
Like
living
mortals
they
hurled
together
and
fought,

haled
the

of

them,
and
nine
dogs
fleet
of

came
after
them.
But
two
terrible
lions
among
the
foremost
kine
had
seized
a
loud-roaring
bull
that
bellowed
mightily
as
they
haled
him,
and
the
dogs
and
the
young
men
sped
after
him.
The
lions
rending
the
great
bull's
hide
were
devouring
his
vitals
and
his
black
blood;
while
the
herdsmen
in
vain
tarred
on
their
fleet
dogs
to
set
on,
for
they
shrank
from
biting
the
lions
but
stood
hard
by
and
barked
and
swerved
away.
Also
the
glorious
lame
god
wrought
therein
a
pasture
in
a
fair
glen,
a
great
pasture
of
white
sheep,
and
a
steading,
and
roofed
huts,
and
folds.
Also
did
the
glorious
lame
god
devise
a
dancing-place
like
unto
that
which
once
in
wide
Knosos
Daidalos
wrought
for
Ariadne
of
the
lovely
tresses.
There
were
youths
danc-
ing
and
maidens
of
costly
wooing,
their
hands
upon
one
another's
wrists.
Fine
linen
the
maidens
had
on,
and
the
youths
well-woven
doublets
faintly
glistening
with
oil
Fair
wreaths
had
the
maidens,
and
the
youths
daggers
of
gold
hanging
from
silver
baldrics.
And
now
would
they
run
round
with
deft
feet
exceeding
lightly,
as
when
a
potter
sitting
by
his
wheel
that

maketh
trial

it

:
and
now
anon
they
would
run
in
lines
to
meet

other.
And
a
great
company
stood
round
the
lovely
dance
in
joy
;
[and
among
them
a

minstrel
was
making
music

How
Achilles
and
Agamemnon
were
reconciled
before
the
assembly
of
the
Achaians,
and
Achilles
went
forth
with
them
to
battle.
Now
Morning
saffron-robed
arose
from
the
streams
of
Ocean
to
bring
light
to
gods
and
men,
and
Thetis
came
to
the
ships,
bearing
his
gift
from
the
god.
Her
dear
son
she
found
fallen
about
Patroklos
and
uttering
loud
lament
;
and
round
him
many
of
his
company
made
moan.
And
the
bright
goddess
stood
beside
him
in
their
midst,
and
clasped
her
hand
in
his
and
spake
and
called
upon
his
name
:
"
My
child,
him
who
lieth
here
we
must
let
be,
for
all
our
pain,
for
by
the
will
of

But
thou
take
from
Hephaistos
arms
of
pride,
arms
passing
goodly,
such
as
no
man
on
his
shoulders
yet
hath
borne."
Thus
spake
the
goddess
and
in
front
of
Achilles
laid
the
arms,
and
they
rang
all
again
in
their
glory.
And
awe
fell
on
all
the
Myrmidons,
nor
dared
any
to
gaze
thereon,
for
they
were
awe-stricken.
But
when
Achilles
looked
thereon,
then
came
fury
upon
him
the
more,
and
his
eyes
blazed
ter-
ribly
forth
as
it
were
a
flame
beneath
their
lids
:
glad
was
he
as
he
held
in
his
hands
that
splendid
gift
of
a
god.
But
when
he
had
satisfied
his
soul
in
gazing
on
the
glory
of
the
arms,
straightway
to
his
mother
spake
he
winged
words
:

him

their
midst
:
"
Son
of
Atreus,
was
this
in
any
wise
the
better
way
for
both
thee
and
me,
what
time
with
grief
at
our
hearts
we
waxed
fierce
in
soul-devouring
strife
for
the
sake
of
a
girl?
Would
that
Artemis
had
slain
her
with
her
arrow
at
the
ships,
on
the
day
whereon
I
took
her
to
me,
when
I
had
spoiled

;
so
should
not
then
so
many
Achaians
have
bitten
the
wide
earth
beneath
their
enemies'
hands,
by
reason
of
my
exceeding
wrath.
It
hath
been
well
for
Hector
and
the
Trojans,
but
the
Achaians
I
think
shall
long
remember
the
strife
that
was
betwixt
thee
and
me.
But
bygones
will
we
let
be,
for
all
our
pain,
and
curb
under
necessity
the
spirit
within
our
breasts.
I
now
will
stay
my
anger
:
it
beseems
me
not
implacably
for
ever
to
be
wroth
;
but
come
rouse
speedily
to
the
fight
the
flowing-haired
Achaians,
that
I
may
go
forth
against
the
men
of
Troy
and
put
them
yet
again
to
the
proof,
if
they
be
fain
to
couch
hard
by
the
ships.
Methinks
that
some
among
them
shall
be
glad
to
rest
their
knees
when
they
are
fled
out
of
the
fierce-
ness
of
the
battle,
and
from
before
our
spear."
He
spake,
and
the
well-greaved
Achaians
rejoiced
that
the
great-hearted
son
of
Peleus
had
made
renouncement
of
his
wrath.
Then
among
them
spake
Agamemnon
king
of
men,
speaking
from
the
place
where
he
sat,
not
arisen
to
stand
forth
in
their
midst
:
"
O
Danaan
friends
and

seemly
is
it
to
listen
to
him
who
standeth

to
speak,
nor
behoveth
it
to
break
in
upon
his
words
:
even
toward
a
skilled
man
that
were
hard.
For
amid
the
uproar

many
men
how
should
one
listen,

yet
speak
?
even
the

speech
is

She
said,
but
sharp
pain
smote
him
in
the
depths
of
his
soul,
and
straight-
way
he
seized
Ate
by
her
bright-haired
head
in
the
anger
of
his
soul,
and
sware
a
mighty
oath
that
never
again

and

heaven
should

who
blindeth

He
said,
and
whirling
her
in
his
hand
flung
her
from
the
starry
heaven,
and
quickly
came
she
down
among
the
works
of
men.
Yet
ever
he
groaned
against
her
when
he
beheld
his
beloved
son
in
cruel
travail
at
Eurystheus'
hest.
Thus
also
I,
what
time
great
Hector
of
the
glancing
helm
was
slaying
Argives
at
the
sterns
of
our
ships,
could
not
be
unmindful
of
Ate,
who
blinded
me
at
the
first.
But
since
thus
blinded
was
I,
and
Zeus
bereft
me
of
my
wit,
fain
am
I
to
make
amends,
and
recompense
manifold
for
the
wrong.
Only
arise
thou
to
the
battle
and
rouse
the
rest
of
the
host.
Gifts
am
I
ready
to
offer,
even
all
that
noble
Odysseus
went
yesterday
to
promise
in
thy
hut
So,
if
thou
wilt,
stay
a
while,
though
eager,
from
battle,
and
&lt;
squires
shall
take
the
gifts
from
my
ship
and
carry
them
to
thee,
that
thou
mayest
see
that
what
I
give
sufficeth
thee."
Then
answered
him
Achilles
swift
of
foot
:
"
Most
noble
son
of
Atreus,
Agamemnon
king
of
men,
for
the
gifts,
to
give
them
as
it
beseemeth,
if
so
thou
wilt,
or
to
withhold,
is
in
thy
choice.
But
now
let
us
bethink
us
of

with
all
speed
;
this
is
no

dally

subtleties,

spear
the
battalions

Thereof

of
you

Then

said
:

they
whom
Hector
son
of
Priam
slew,
when
Zeus
gave
him
glory
—
and
ye
call
men
to
their

Verily
for
my
part
I
would
bid
the
sons
of
the
Achaians
to
fight
now
unfed
and
fasting,
and
with
the
set-
ting
sun
make
ready
a
mighty
meal,
when
we
shall
have
avenged
the
shame.
Till
then
down
my
throat
at

nor
food
nor

shall
go,
since
my
comrade
is
dead,
who
in
my
hut
is
lying
mangled
by
the
sharp
spear,
with
his
feet
toward
the
door,

round
him
our

mourn;
wherefore
in

is
no

of
those
matters,

of
slaying,
and
blood,

of
men."

him
Odysseus

"

arose
up

in

:
"

Zeus,

Never
could

not

willed
that

of
the
Achaians
death
should
come.
But
now
go
forth
to
your
meal,
that
we
may
join

thereupon."
Thus
he
spake
and
dispersed
the
assembly
with
all
speed.
The
rest
were
scattered
each
to
his
own
ship,
but
the
great-
hearted
Myrmidons
took
up
the
gifts,
and
bare
them
to
the
ship
of
godlike
Achilles.
And
they
laid
them
in
the
huts
and
set
the
women
there,

Thus
spake
he
weeping,
and
the
elders
mourned
with
him,
bethinking
them
what
each
had
left
at
home.
And
when
the
son
of
Kronos
beheld
them
sorrowing
he
pitied
them,
and
forthwith
to
Athene
spake
he
winged
words
:
"
My
child,
thou
hast
then
left
utterly
the
man
of
thy
heart.
Hath
Achilles
then
no
longer
a
place
within

?
He
before
the
steep-prowed
ships
sits
mourning
his
dear
comrade
;
the
rest
are
gone
to
their
meal,
but
he
is
fasting
and
unfed.
But
go,
distil
into
his
breast
nectar
and
pleasant
ambrosia,
that
no
pains
of
hunger
come
on
him."
Thus
saying
he
sped
forward
Athene
who
before
was
fain.
And
she,
like
a
falcon
wide-winged
and
shrill-voiced,
hurled
herself
forth
from
heaven
through
the
upper
air.
So
while
the
Achaians
were
arming
presently
throughout
the
camp,
she
in
Achilles'
breast
distilled
nectar
and
pleasant
ambrosia,
that
grievous
hunger
might
not
assail
his
knees,
and
then
herself
was
gone
to
the
firm
house
of
her
mighty
father.
Then
the
Achaians
poured
forth

ships.

sprang
up
behind

and
after
him
mounted
Achilles
armed,
effulgent
in
his
armour
like
bright
Hyperion.
And
terribly
he
called
upon
the
horses
of
his
sire
:
"
Xanthos
and
Balios,
famed
children
of
Podarge,
in
other
sort
take
heed
to
bring
your
charioteer
safe
back
to
the
Danaan
host,
when
we
have
done
with

and
leave
him
not
as
ye
left
Patroklos
to
lie
there
dead."
Then
the
horse
Xanthos
of
glancing
feet
made
answer
unto
him
from
beneath
the
yoke
;
—
and
he
bowed
with
his
head,
and
all
his
mane
fell
from
the
yoke
-cushion
beside
the
yoke
and
touched
the
ground;
—
for
the
white-armed
goddess
Hera
gave
him
speech
:
"
Yea
verily
for
this
hour,
dread
Achilles,
we
will
still
bear
thee
safe,
yet
is
thy
death-
day
nigh
at
hnnd,
neither
shall
we
be
cause
thereof,
but
a
mighty
god,
and
forceful
Fate.
For
not
through
sloth
or
heedlessness
of
ours
did
the
men
of
Troy
from
Patroklos'
shoulders
strip
his
arms,
but
the
best
of
the
gods,
whom
bright-haired
Leto
bore,
slew
him
in
the

of
the

to
Hector

and

Now
when
he
had
thus
spoken
the
Erinyes
stayed
his
voice.
And
sore
troubled
did
fleet-footed
Achilles
answer
him
:
"
Xanthos,

?

He
said,
and
with
a
cry
among
the
foremost
held
on
his
whole-hooved
steeds.

But
for
me
I
will
abide
here,
sitting
within

of

where
I
will
gladden
my
heart
with
gazing
;

come
among
the
Trojans
and
Achaians
and
succour
these
or
those,
how-
soever
each
of
you
hath
a

For
if
Achilles
alone
shall
fight
against
the
Trojans,
not
even
a

shall
they
hold
back
the
son
of
Peleus,
the
fleet
of

Nay,
but

they
trembled
when
they
looked
upon
him
;
now
therefore
that

for
his
friend
is
waxen

I
fear
me
lest
he
overleap
the
bound
of
fate,
and
storm
the
wall."
Thus
spake
the
son
of
Kronos,
and
roused
unabating
war.
For
on
this
side
and
on
that
the
gods
went
forth
to
war
:
to
the
company
of
the
ships
went
Hera,
and
Pallas
Athene,
and
Poseidon,
Earth
-
enfolder,
and
the
Helper
Hermes,
pre-eminent
in
subtle
thoughts;
and
with
these
went
Hephaistos
in
the
greatness
of
his
strength,
halting,
but
his
shrunk
legs
moved
nimbly
under
him
:
but
to
the
Trojans
went
Ares
of
the
glancing
helm,
and
with
him
Phoebus
of
the
unshorn
hair,
and
archer
Artemis,
and
Leto
and
Xanthos
and
laughter-loving
Aphrodite.
Now
for
so
long
as
gods
were
afar
from
mortal
men,
so
long
waxed
the
Achaians
glorious,
for
that
Achilles
was
come
forth
among
them,
and
his
long
ceasing
from
grim
battle
was
at
an
end.
And
the
Trojans
were
smitten
with
sore
trem-
bling
in
the
limbs
of
every
one
of
them,
in
terror
when
they
beheld
the
son
of

blazing
in
his
arms,
peer
of
man-slaying
Ares.

'
.'
I
402
ILIAD

86-118.
And
to
him
Aineias
answered
and
said
:
"
Son
of
Priam,
why
biddest
thou
me
thus
face
the
fierce
son
of
Peleus
in
battle,
though
I
be
not
fain
thereto
?
Not
for
the
first
time
now
shall
I
match
me
with
Achilles,
fleet
of
foot
;
once
before
drave
he
me
with
his
spear
from
Ida,
when
he
harried
our
kine
and
wasted
Lyrnessos
and
Pedasos
;
but
Zeus
delivered
me
out
of
his
hand
and
put
strength
into
my
knees
that
they
were
swift.
Else
had
I
fallen
beneath
the
hands
of
Achilles,
and
of
Athene
who
went
before
and
gave
him
light,
and
urged
him
to
slay
Leleges
and
Trojans
with
his
spear
of
bronze.
Therefore
it
is
impossible
for
man
to
face
Achilles
in
fight,
for
that
ever
some
god
is
at
his
side
to
ward
off
death.
Ay,
and
at
any
time
his
spear
flieth
straight,
neither
ceaseth
till
it
have
pierced
through
flesh
of
man.
But
if
God
once
give
us
fair
field
of
battle,
not
lightly
shall
he
overcome
me,
not
though
he
boast
him
made
of
bronze
throughout."
And
to
him
in
answer
spake
Apollo
son
of
Zeus
:
"
Yea,
hero,
pray
thou
too
to
the
everliving
gods
;
for
thou
too,
men
say,
wast
born
of
Aphrodite
daughter
of
Zeus,
and
Achilles'
mother
is
of
less
degree
among
the
gods.
For
thy
mother
is

Come,
bear
up
thy
unwearying
spear
against
him,
let
him
no

thee
back
with
revilings
and
bitter
words."
He
said,
and
breathed
high
spirit
into
the
shepherd
of
the
host,
and
he
went
onward
through
the
forefront
of
the
fight-
ing,
harnessed
in

bronze.
But
white-armed
Hera
failed
not
to
discern
Anchises'

he
went
through

press
of
men
to
meet
the
son
of
Peleus,
and
gathering
the
gods
about

she
spake
among
them
thus
:
"

of

Thus
they
on
either
side
sat
devising
counsels,
but
shrank
all
from
falling
to
grievous
war,
and
Zeus
from
his
high
seat
commanded
them.
Meanwhile
the
whole
plain
was
filled
with
men
and
horses,
and
ablaze
with
bronze
;
and
the
earth
rang
with
the
feet
of
them
as
they
rushed
together
in
the
fray.
Two
men
far
better
than
the
rest
were
meeting
in
the
midst
between
the
hosts,
eager
for
battle,
Aineias,
Anchises'
son,
and
noble
Achilles.
First
came
on
Aineias
threateningly,
tossing
his
strong
helm
;
his
rapid
shield
he
held
before
his
breast,
and
brandished
his
bronze
spear.
And
on
the
other
side
the
son
of
Peleus
rushed
to
meet
him,
like
a
lion,
a
ravaging
lion
whom
men
desire
to
slay,
a
whole
tribe
assembled
:
and
first
he
goeth
his
way
unheeding,
but
when
some
warrior
youth
hath
smitten
him
with
a
spear,
then
he
gathereth
him-

and
foam

with

tail
he
scourgeth
either
side
his

and

and
goadeth
himself
on
to

and
glaring
is
borne
straight
on

by
his

to
try

he
shall

whether

shall
perish

And
when

Poseidon,
Shaker

with
speed,

straightway
spoken
among

gods
:

Alas,

that
he
will
obey
the
words
of
Apollo
the
far-darter,
fond
man,
but
nowise
shall
the
god
help
him
from
grievous
death.
But
wherefore
now
is
he
to
suffer
ill
in
his
innocence,
causelessly
for
others'
wickedness,1
yet
welcome
ever
are
his
offerings
to
the
gods
who
inhabit
the
spacious
heaven
?
Come,
let
us
guide
him
out
of
death's
way,
lest
the
son
of
Kronos
be
wroth,
if
Achilles
slay
him
;
for
it
is
appointed
to
him
to
escape,
that
the
race
of
Dardanos
perish
not
without
seed
or
sign,
even
Dardanos
whom
the
son
of
Kronos
loved
above
all
the
children
born
to
him
from
the
daughters
of
men.
For
the
race
of
Priam
hath
Zeus
already
hated.
But
thus
shall
the
might
of
Aineias
reign
among
the
Trojans,
and
his
children's
children,
who
shall
be
born
in
the
after-
time."
And
him
then
answered
Hera
the
ox-eyed
queen
:
"Shaker
of
earth,
thyself
with
thine
own
mind
take
counsel,
whether
thou
wilt
save
Aineias,
or
leave
him
[to
be
slain,
brave
though
he
be,
by
Achilles,
Peleus'
son].
For
by
many
oaths
among
all
the
Immortals
have
we
two
sworn,
even
Pallas
Athene
and
I,
never
to
help
the
Trojans
from
their

day,
not
even
when

shall
burn
in
the
burning
of
fierce
fire,
and
they
that
burn
her
shall
be
the
warlike
sons
of
the
Achaians."
Now
when
Poseidon
Shaker
of

heard
that,
he
went
up
amid
the
battle
and
the
clash
of
spears,
and
came
where
Aineias
and
renowned
Achilles
were.
Then
presently
he
shed

and

all
:
not
even
Ares,
though
an
immortal
god,
nor
Athene,
could
plunge
into
the
jaws
of
such
a
fray
and
toil
therein.
But
to

no

I

Thus
spake
he
urging
them.
But
to
the
Trojans
glorious
Hector
called
aloud,
and
proclaimed
that
he
would
go
forth
against
Achilles
:
"
High-hearted
Trojans,
fear
not
Peleus'
son.
I
too
in
words
could
fight
even
Immortals,
but
with
the
spear
it
were
hard,
for
they
are
stronger
far.
Neither
shall
Achilles
accomplish
all
his
talk,
but
part
thereof
he
is
to
accomplish,
and
part
to
break
asunder
in
the
midst.
And
against
him
will
I
go
forth,
though
the
hands
of
him
be
even
as
fire,
yea
though
his
hands
be
as
fire
and
his
fierce-
ness
as
the
flashing
steel."
Thus
spake
he
urging
them,
and
the
Trojans
raised
their
spears
for
battle;
and
their
fierceness
was
mingled
con-
fusedly,
and
the
battle-cry
arose.
Then
Phoebus
Apollo
stood
by
Hector
and
spake
to
him
:
"
Hector,
no
longer
challenge
Achilles
at
all
before
the
lines,
but
in
the
throng
await
him
and
from

the
roar
of
the
battle,
lest
hapiy

thee
or
come

thee
with

sword."
Thus
spake
he,
and
Hector
again
fell
back
into
the
crowd
of
men,
for
he
was
amazed
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
god's
voice.
But
Achilles
sprang
in
among
the
Trojans,
his
heart
clothed
with
strength,
crying
his

Then
when
Hector
saw
his

Polydoros
clasping
his

with

and
sinking
to
the
earth,
a
mist
fell
over

nor

might
he
endure
to
range
so
far
apart,
but
he
came
up
against
Achilles
brandishing
his
sharp
spear,
and
like
a
flame
of
fire.
And
Achilles
when
he
saw
him,
sprang
up,
and
spake
exultingly
:
"
Behold
the
man
who
hath
deepest
stricken
into

who
slew
my
dear-

friend
;
not
long
shall
we
now
shrink
from

along

highways
of

He
said,
and
looking
grimly
spake
unto
goodly
Hector
:
"
Come
thou
near,
that
the
sooner
thou
mayest
arrive
at
the
goal
of
death."
Then
to
him,
unterrified,
said
Hector
of
the
glancing
helm
:
"
Son
of
Peleus,
think
not
with
words
to
affright
me
as
a
child,
since
I
too
know
myself
how
to
speak
taunts
and
unjust
speech.
And
I
know
that
thou
art
a
man
of
might,
and
a
far
better
man
than
I.
Yet
doth
this
issue
lie
in
the
lap
of
the
gods,
whether
I
though
weaker
shall
take
thy
life
with
my
hurled
spear,
for
mine
too
hath
been
found
keen
ere
now.'
He
said,
and
poised
his
spear
and
hurled
it,
and
Athene
with
a
breath
turned
it
back
from
glorious
Achilles,
breath-
ing
very
lightly
;
and
it
came
back
to
goodly
Hector,
and
fell
there
before
his
feet.
Then
Achilles
set
fiercely
upon
him,
eager
to
slay
him,
crying
his
terrible
cry.
But
Apollo
caught
Hector
up,
very
easily,
as
a
god
may,
and
hid
him
in
thick
mist.
Thrice
then
did

Achilles

and

[But

then
with

he
spake
to

:

so
along
the
channels
of
that
dread
stream
the
Trojans
crouched
beneath
the
pre-
cipitous
sides.
And
when
his
hands
were
weary
of
slaughter
he
chose
twelve
young
men
alive
out
of
the
river,
an
atone-
ment
for
Patroklos
Menoitios'
son
that
was
dead.
These
brought
he
forth
amazed
like
fawns,
and
bound
behind
them
their
hands
with
well-cut
thongs,
which
they
themselves
wore
on
their
pliant
doublets,
and
gave
them
to
his
comrades
to
lead
down
to
the
hollow
ships.
Then
again
he
made
his
onset,
athirst
for
slaying.
There
met
he
a
son
of
Dardanid
Priam,
in
flight
out
of
the
river,
Lykaon,
whom
once
himself
he
took
and
brought
unwilling
out
of
his
father's
orchard,
in
a
night
assault
;
he
was
cutting
with
keen
bronze
young
shoots
of
a
wild
fig
tree,
to
be
hand-rails
of
a
chariot;
but
to
him
an
unlooked-for
bane
came
goodly
Achilles.
And
at
that
time
he
sold
him
into
well-peopled
Lemnos,
sending
him
on
ship
board,
and
the
son
of
Jason
gave
a
price
for
him
;
and
thence
a
guest
friend
freed
him
with
a
great
ransom,
Ee'tion
of
Imbros,
and
sent
him
to
goodly
Arisbe
;
whence
flying
secretly
he
came
to
his
father's
house.
Eleven
days
he
rejoiced
among
his
friends
after
he
was

from
Lemnos,
but
on

saw

neither
had
he
a

had
thrown
all
to

;
for
he
sweated
grievously
as
he
tried
to
flee
out
of
the
river,
and
his
knees
were
failing
him
for
weariness
:
then
in
wrath
spake
Achilles
to
his
great
heart
:
"

the

Then
Lykaon
besought
him,
with

while
with
the
other
he
held
the

spear
and
loosed

among
the

of
the
foot-soldiers
didst
thou
lay
low,
even

Polydoros,
when
thou
smotest
him
with
thy

spear
:

now

hard

for

I
to

since

Yet
one
thing
will
I
tell
thee,

do
thou
lay
it
to
heart
:
slay
me
not,
since
I
am
not
of
the
same
mother
as
Hector,
who
slew
thy
comrade
the
gentle
and
brave."
Thus
spake
to
him
the
noble
son
of
Priam,
beseeching
him
with
words,
but
he
heard
a
voice
implacable
:
"
Fond
fool,
proffer
me
no
ransom,
nor
these
words.
Until
Patroklos
met
his
fated
day,
then
was
it
welcomer
to
my
soul
to
spare
the
men
of
Troy,
and
many
I
took
alive
and
sold
beyond
the
sea
:
but
now
there
is
none
shall
escape
death,
whom-
soever
before
Ilios
God
shall
deliver
into
my
hands
—
yea,
even
among
all
Trojans,
but
chiefest
among
Priam's
sons.
Ay,
friend,
thou
too
must
die
:
why
thus
lamentest
thou
?
Patroklos
too
is
dead,
who
was
better
far
than
thou.
Seest
thou
not
also
what
manner
of
man
am
I
for
might
and
goodliness
?
and
a
good
man
was
my
father,
and
a
goddess
mother
bare
me.
Yet
over
me
too
hang
death
and
forceful
fate.
There
cometh
morn
or
eve
or
some
noonday
when
my
life
too
some
man
shall
take
in
battle,
whether
with
spear
he
smite
or
arrow
from
the
string."
Thus
spake
he,
and
the
other's
knees
and
heart
were
un-
strung.
He
let
go
Achilles'
spear,
and
sat
with
both
hands
outspread.
But
Achilles
drew
his
sharp
sword
and
smote
on
the
collar-bone
beside
the
neck,
and
all
the
two-edged
sword
sank
into
him,
and
he
lay
stretched
prone
upon
the
earth,
and
blood
flowed
dark
from
him
and
soaked
the
earth.
Him
seized
Achilles
by
the
foot
and
sent
him
down
the
stream,
and
over
him
exulting
spake
winged
words
:
"
There

which

Thus
spake
he,
but
the
River
waxed
ever
more
wroth
in
his
heart,
and
sought
in
his
soul
how
he
should
stay
goodly
Achilles
from
his
work,
and

destruction
from
the
Trojans.

the

and
he,
men
say,

father.1
Now
fight
we,
noble
Achilles!"
Thus
spake
he
in
defiance,
and
goodly
Achilles
lifted
the
Pelian
ash
:
but
the
warrior
Asteropaios
hurled
with
both
spears
together,
for
he
could
use
both
hands
alike,
and
with
the
one
spear
smote
the
shield,
but
pierced
it
not
right
through,
for
the
gold
stayed
it,
the
gift
of
a
god
;
and
with
the
other
he
grazed
the
elbow
of
Achilles'
right
arm,
and
there
leapt
forth
dark
blood,
but
the
point
beyond
him
fixed
itself
in
the
earth,
eager
to
batten
on
flesh.
Then
in
his
turn
Achilles
hurled
on
Asteropaios
his
straight-flying
ash,
fain
to
have
slain
him,
but
missed
the
man
and
struck
the
high
bank,
and
quivering
half
its
length
in
the
bank
he
left
the
ashen
spear.
Then
the
son
of
Peleus
drew
his
sharp
sword
from
his
thigh
and
leapt
fiercely
at
him,
and
he
availed
not
to
draw
with
his
stout
hand
Achilles'
ashen
shaft
from
the
steep
bank.
Thrice
shook
he
it
striving
to
draw
it
forth,
and
thrice
gave
up
the
strain,
but
the
fourth
time
he
was
fain
to
bend
and
break
the
ashen
spear
of
the
seed
of
Aiakos,
but
ere
that
Achilles
closing
on
him
reft
him
of
life
with
his
sword.
For
in
the
belly
he
smote
him
beside
the
navel,
and
all
his
bowels
gushed
out
to
the
earth,
and
darkness
covered
his
eyes
as
he
lay
gasping.
Then
Achilles
trampling
on
his
breast
stripped
off
his
armour
and
spake
exultingly
:
"Lie
there
!
It
is
hard
to
strive
against
children
of
Kronos'
mighty
son,
even
though
one

sprung

a
River-god.
Thou

Thus
saying,
he
set
upon
the
Trojans,
like
a

Then
unto
Apollo
spake
the
deep-eddying
River:
"Out
on
it,
lord
of
the
silver
bow,
child
of
Zeus,
thou
hast
not
kept
the
ordinance
of
Kronos'
son,
who
charged

to

by
the
Trojans
and
to
help
them,
until

late-setting,
and
darken

deep-soiled
earth."
He
said,
and
spear-famed
Achilles
sprang
from
the
bank
and
leapt
into
his
midst
;
but
he
rushed
on
him
in
a
furious
wave,
and
stirred
up
all
his
streams
in
tumult,
and
swept
down
the
many
dead
who
lay
thick
in
him,
slain
by
Achilles
;
these
out
to
land
he
cast
with
bellowing
like
a
bull,
and
saved
the
living
under
his
fair
streams,
hiding
them
within
eddies
deep
and
wide.
But
terribly
around
Achilles
arose
his
tumultuous
wave,
and
the
stream
smote
violently
against
his
shield,
nor
availed
he
to
stand
firm
upon
his
feet.
Then
he
grasped
a
tall
fair-grown
elm,
and
it
fell
uprooted
and
tore
away
all
the
bank,
and
reached
over

:
and
Achilles,
struggling
out
of
the
eddy,
made
haste
to
fly
over
the
plain
with
his
swift
feet,
for
he
was
afraid.
But
the
great
god
ceased
not,
but
arose
upon
him
with
darkness
on
his
crest,
that
he
might
stay
noble
Achilles
from
slaughter,
and
ward
destruction
from
the
men
of
Troy.
And
the
son
of
Peleus
rushed
away
a
spear's
throw,
with
the
swoop
of
a
black
eagle,
the
mighty
hunter,
strongest
at
once
and
swiftest
of
winged
birds.
Like
him
he
sped,
and
on
his
breast
the
bronze
rang
terribly
as
he
fled
from
beneath
the
onset,
and
behind
him
the
River
rushed
on
with
a
mighty
roar.

the

was

rush

and
devouring
the

from

Then
the
son
of
Peleus
cried
aloud,
looking
up
to
the
br&lt;
heaven
:
"Zeus,
Father,

Thus
spake
he,
and

stood
beside

in

likeness
of

They
having
thus
spoken
departed
to
the
immortals,
but
he
toward
the
plain
—
for
the
bidding
of
gods
was
strong
upon
him
—
went
onward
;
and
all
the
plain
was
filled
with
water-flood,
and
many
beautiful
arms
and
corpses
of
slain
youths
were
drifting
there.
So
upward
sprang
his
knees
as
he
rushed
against
the
stream
right
on,
nor
stayed
him
the
wide-flowing
River,
for
Athene
put
great
strength
in
him.
Neither
did
Skamandros
slacken
his
fierceness,
but
yet
more
raged
against
the
son
of
Peleus,
and
he
curled
crest-
wise
the
billow
of
his
stream,
lifting
himself
on
high,
and
on
Simoeis
he
called
with
a
shout
:
"
Dear
brother,
the
strength
of
this
man
let
us
both
join
to
stay,
since
quickly
he
will
lay
waste
the
great
city
of
king
Priam,
and
the
Trojans
abide
not
in
the
battle.
Help
me
with
speed,
and
fill
thy
streams
with
water
from
thy
springs,
and
urge
on
all
thy
torrents,
and
raise
up
a
great
wave,
and
stir
huge
roaring
of
tree-stumps
and
stones,
that
we
may
stay
the
fierce
man
who
now
is
lording
it,
and
deeming
himself
match
for
gods.
For
neither,
I
ween,
will
strength
avail
him,
nor
comeliness
anywise,
nor
that
armour
beautiful,
which
deep
beneath
the
flood
shall
be
o'erlaid
with

and
himself
I
will
wrap
him
in

sands
and
pour
round
him
countless

without

nor
shall
the
Achaians
know
where
to

so

be

neither
shall
he
have

to
be

make

He
said,
and
rushed
in
tumult
on
Achilles,
raging
from
on
high,
thundering
with
foam
and
blood
and
bodies
of
dead
men.
Then

And
as

beset
with
much
fire,
melting
the

—
so
burned
his
fair
streams
in
the
fire,
and
the
water
boiled.
He
had
no
mind
to
flow,
but
refrained
him,
for
the
breath
of
cunning
Hephaistos
violently
afflicted
him.
Then
unto
Hera,
ear-
nestly
beseeching
her,
he
spake
winged
words
:
"
Hera,
wherefore
hath
thy
son
assailed
my
stream
to
vex
it
above
others?
I
am
less
chargeable
than
all
the
rest
that
are
helpers
of
the
Trojans.
But
lo,
I
will
give
over,
if
thou
wilt,
and
let
thy
son
give
over
too.
And
I
further
will
swear
even
this,
that
never
will
I
ward
the
day
of
evil
from
the
Trojans,
not
even
when
all
Troy
is
burning
in
the
blaze
of
hungry
fire,
and
the
warlike
sons
of
Achaians
are
the
burners
thereof."
Then
when
the
white-
armed
goddess
Hera
heard
his
speech,
straightway
she
spake
unto
Hephaistos
her
dear
son
:
"
Hephaistos,
hold,
famed
son
;
it
befitteth
not
thus
for
mortals'
sake
to
do
violence
to
an
immortal
god."
Thus
said
she
and
Hephaistos
quenched
the
fierce-blazing
fire,
and
the
wave
once
more
rolled
down
the
fair
river-bed.
So
when
the
rage
of
Xanthos
was
overcome,
both
ceased,
for
Hera
stayed
them,
though
in
wrath.
But
among
the
other
gods
fell
grievous
bitter
strife,
and
their
hearts
were
carried
diverse
in
their
breasts.
And
they
clashed
together
with
a
great
noise,
and
the
wide
earth
groaned,
and
the
clarion
of
great
Heaven
rang
around.
Zeus
heard
as
he
sate
upon
Olympus,
and
his
heart
within
him
laughed
pleasantly
when
he
beheld
that
strife
of
gods.
Then
no
longer
stood
they
asunder,
for
Ares
piercer
of
shields
began
the
battle
and
first
made
for
Athene
with
his
bronze
spear,
and
spake
a
taunting
word
:
"

So
they
twain
lay
on
the
bounteous
earth,
and
she
spake
winged
words
exultingly:
"
Such
let
all
be
who
give
the

jans
aid
when
they
fight
against
the

Be
they

so

and
brave
as
Aphrodite
when
she
came

and

Then
should
we
long

have
ceased
from
war,
having
laid
waste
the
stablished
citadel
of
Ilios."
[She
said,
and
the
white-armed
goddess
Hera
smiled.]
Then
to
Apollo
spake
the
earth-shaking
lord:
"Phoebus,
why
stand
we
apart
?
It
befitteth
not
after
the
rest
have
begun
:
that
were
the
more
shameful
if
without
fighting
we
should
go
to
Olympus
to
the
bronze-thresholded
house
of
Zeus.
Begin,
for
thou
art
younger
;
it
were
not
meet
for
me,
since
I
was
born
first
and
know
more.
Fond
god,
how
foolish
is
thy
heart
!
Thou
rememberest
not
all
the
ills
we
twain
alone
of
gods
endured
at
Ilios,
when
by
ordi-
nance
of
Zeus
we
came
to
proud
Laomedon
and
served
him
through
a
year
for
promised
recompense,
and
he
laid
on
us
his
commands.
I
round
their
city
built
the
Trojans
a
wall,
wide
and
most
fair,
that
the
city
might
be
unstormed,
and
thou,
Phoebus,
didst
herd
shambling
crook-horned
kine
among
the
spurs
of
woody
many-folded
Ida.
But
when
the
joyous
seasons
were
accomplishing
the
term
of
hire,
then
redoubtable
Laomedon
robbed
us
of
all
hire,
and
sent
us
off
with
threats.
He
threatened
that
he
would
bind
together
our
feet
and
hands
and
sell
us
into
far-off
isles,
and
the
ears
of
both
of
us
he
vowed
to
shear
off
with
the
sword.
So
we
went
home
with
angry
hearts,
wroth
for
the
hire
he
promised
and
gave
us
not.
To
his
folk
now
thou
showest
favour,
nor
essayest
with
us
how
the
proud
Trojans
may
be
brought
low
and
perish
miserably
with
their
children
and
noble
wives."
Then
to
him
answered
King
Apollo
the
Far-darter:

bow
and
arrows
where
they
lay.
Then
to
Leto
spake
the
Guide,
the
slayer
of
Argus
:
"
Leto,
with
thee
will
I
no
wise
fight
;
a
grievous
thing
it
is
to
come
to
blows
with
wives
of
cloud-gathering
Zeus
;
but
boast
to
thy
heart's
content
among
the
immortal
gods
that
thou
didst
vanquish
me
by
might
and
main."
Thus
said
he,
and
Leto
gathered
up
the
curved
bow
and
arrows
fallen
hither
and
thither
amid
the
whirl
of
dust
:
so
taking
her
daughter's
bow
she
went
back.
And
the
maiden
came
to
Olympus,
to
the
bronze-thresholded
house
of
Zeus,
and
weeping
set
herself
on
her
father's
knee,
while
round
her
her
divine
vesture
quivered
:
and
her
father,
Kronos'
son,
took
her
to
him
and
asked
of
her,
laughing
gently
:
"
Who
of
the
inhabitants
of
heaven,
dear
child,
hath
dealt
with
thee
thus
[hastily,
as
though
thou
hadst
been
doing
some
wrong
thing
openly]
?
"
And
to
him
in
answer
spake
the
fair-crowned
queen
of
the
echoing
chase
:
"
It
was
thy
wife
that
buffeted
me,
father,
the
white-armed
Hera,
from
whom
are
strife
and
contention
come
upon
the
immortals."
Thus
talked
they
unto
one
another.
Then
Phoebus
Apollo
entered
into
sacred
Ilios,
for
he
was
troubled
for
the
wall
of
the
well-builded
city,
lest
the
Danaans
waste
it
before
its
hour
upon
that
day.
But
the
other
ever-living
gods
went
to
Olympus,
some
angry
and
some
greatly
triumphing,
and
sat
down
beside
Zeus
who
hideth
himself
in
dark
clouds.
Now
Achilles
was
still
slaying
the
Trojans,
both
themselves
and
their
whole-hooved
horses.
And
as
when
a
smoke
goeth
up
to
the
broad
heaven,
when
a
city
burneth,
kindled
by
the
wrath
of
gods,
and
causeth
toil
to
all,
and
griefs
to
many,
thus
caused
Achilles
toil
and
griefs
to
the
Trojans.

And
the

on

tower,
and

of
dread
Achilles,
how
before
him
the
Trojans

Tl
cry
he
went
down
from

to
rouse
the
gallant

along
the
walls
:
"

for
I

lest

Thus
spake
he,
and
they

gates

bolts
;
and

Then
Apollo
leapt
forth
to
the
front
that
he
might
ward

tion
from
the
Trojans.
They
straight
for
the
city
and
high
wall
were
fleeing,
parched
with
thirst
and
dust-grimed
from
the
plain,
and
Achilles
chased
them
vehemently
with
his
spear,
for
strong
frenzy
possessed
his
heart
continually,
and
he
thirsted
to
win
him
renown.
Then

side
that
he
might

and

So
then
at
evening,
having
bathed
in
the
river
and
refreshed
me
of
sweat,
I
might
return
to
Ilios.
Nay,
why
doth
my
heart
debate
thus
within
me
?
Lest
he
might
be
aware
of
me
as
I
get
me
from
the

for
the
plain,
and
speeding

overtake
me
with

;
then
will
it
no
more
be
possible
to
avoid
the
visitation
of
death,
for
he
is
exceeding
mighty
above
all
mankind.
What
then
if
in

of
the
city
I
go
forth
to
meet
him
?
Surely
his
flesh
too
is
pene-

by

and
there
is
but
one
life
within,
and
men
say
he
is

howbeit

the
son
of

giveth
him
renown."
Thus
saying,
he
gathered
himself
to
await
Achilles,
and
within
him
his
stout
heart
was
set
to
strive
and
fight.

so
noble
Antenor's
son,
goodly
Agenor,
refused
to
flee
till
he
should
put
Achilles
to
the
proof,
but
held
before
him
the
circle
of
his
shield,
and
aimed
at
him
with
his
spear,
and
cried
aloud
:
"
Doubtless
thou
hopest
in
thy
heart,
noble
Achilles,
on
this
day
to
sack
the
city
of
the
proud
men
of
Troy.
Fond
man,
there
shall

for

we

who

keep

;
but
thou
shalt
here
meet

albeit
so
redoubtable
and

of

He
said,
and
hurled
his
sharp
spear
with
weighty
hand,
and
smote
him
on
the
leg
beneath
the
knee,
nor

How
Achilles
fought
with
Hector,
and
slew
him,
and
brought
his
body
to
the
ships.
THUS
they
throughout
the
city,
scared
like
fawns,
were
cool-
ing
their
sweat
and
drinking
and
slaking
their
thirst,
leaning
on
the
fair
battlements,
while
the
Achaians
drew
near
the
wall,
setting
shields
to
shoulders.
But
Hector
deadly
fate
bound
to
abide
in
his
place,
in
front
of
Ilios
and
the
Skaian
gates.
Then
to
the
son
of
Peleus
spake
Phoebus
Apollo
:
"
Wherefore,
son
of
Peleus,
pursuest
thou
me
with
swift
feet,
thyself
being
mortal
and
I
a
deathless
god
?
Thou
hast
not
even
yet
known
me,
that
I
am
a
god,
but
strivest
vehemently.
Truly
thou
regardest
not
thy
task
among
the
affliction
of
the
Trojans
whom
thou
affrightedst,
who
now
are
gathered
into
the
city,
while
thou
hast
wandered
hither.
Me
thou
wilt
never
slay,
for
I
am
not
subject
unto
death."
Then
mightily
moved
spake
unto
him
Achilles
fleet
of
foot
:
"
Thou
hast
baulked
me,
Far-darter,
most
mischievous
of
all
the
gods,
in
that
thou
hast
turned
me
hither

:
else

Now
hast
thou
robbed
me
of
great
renown,
and
lightly
hast
saved
them,
because
thou
hadst
no
vengeance
to
fear
thereafter.
Verily
I
would
avenge
me
on
thee,
had
I

the

it

it
to

Thus
pondered
he
as
he
stood,
but
nigh
on
him
came
Achilles,
peer
of
Enyalios
warrior
of
the
waving
helm,
brandishing
from
his
right
shoulder
the
Pelian
ash,
his
terrible
spear
;
and
all
around
the
bronze
on
him
flashed
like
the
gleam
of
blazing
fire
or
of
the
Sun
as
he
ariseth.
And
trembling
seized
Hector
as
he
was
aware
of
him,
nor
endured
he
to
abide
in
his
place,
but
left
the
gates
behind
him
and
fled
in
fear.
And
the
son
of
Peleus
darted
after
him,
trust-
ing
in
his
swift
feet.
As
a
falcon
upon
the
mountains,
swiftest
of
winged
things,
swoopeth
fleetly
after
a
trembling
dove
;
and
she
before
him
fleeth,
while
he
with
shrill
screams
hard
at
hand
still
darteth
at
her,
for
his
heart
urgeth
him
to
seize
her
;
so
Achilles
in
hot
haste
flew
straight
for
him,
and
Hector
fled
beneath
the
Trojans'
wall,
and
plied
swift
knees.
They
past
the
watch-place
and
wind-waved
wild
figtree
sped
ever,
away
from
under
the
wall,
along
the
waggon-track,
and
came
to
the
two
fair-flowing
springs,
where
two
fountains
rise
that
feed
deep-eddying
Skamandros.
The
one
floweth
with
warm
water,
and
smoke
goeth
up
therefrom
around
as
it
were
from
a
blazing
fire,
while
the
other
even
in
summer
floweth
forth
like
cold
hail
or
snow
or
ice
that
water
formeth.
And
there
beside
the
springs
are
broad
washing-troughs
hard
by,
fair
troughs
of
stone,
where
wives
and
fair
daughters
of
the

of
Troy
were
wont
to

raiment,
in
the
old
time

before
the

of

came.

as
he
set
himself
to
dart
under
the
well
built
walls
over
against
the
Dardanian
gates,
if
haply
from
above
they
might
succour
him
with
darts,
so
oft
would
Achilles
gain
on
him
and
turn
him
toward
the
plain,
while
himself
he
sped
ever
on
the
city-
side.
And
as
in
a
dream
one
faileth
in

of
a
flying
man—
the
one
faileth
in
his
flight
and
the
other
in
his
chase
—
so
failed
Achilles
to
overtake
him
in
the
race,
and
Hector
to
escape.
And
thus1
would
Hector
have
avoided
the
visi-
tation
of
death,
had
not
this
time
been
utterly
the
last
wherein
Apollo
came
nigh
to
him,
who
nerved
his
strength
and
his
swift
knees.
For
to
the
host
did
noble
Achilles
sign
with
his
head,
and
forbade
them
to
hurl
bitter
darts
against
Hector,
lest
any
smiting
him
should
gain
renown,
and
he
himself
come
second.
But
when
the
fourth
time
they
had
reached
the
springs,
then
the
Father
hung
his
golden
balances,
and
set
therein
two
lots
of
dreary
death,
one
of
Achilles,
one
of
horse-taming
Hector,
and
held
them
by
the
midst
and
poised.
Then
Hector's
fated
clay
sank
down,
and
fell
to
the
house
of
Hades,
and
Phoebus
Apollo
left
him.
But
to
Peleus'
son
came
the
bright-eyed
goddess
Athene,
and
stand-
ing
near
spake
to
him
winged
words
:
"
Now
verily,
glori-
ous
Achilles
dear
to
Zeus,
I
have
hope
that
we
twain
shall
carry
off
great
glory
to
the
ships
for
the
Achaians,
having
slain
Hector,
for
all
his
thirst
for
fight.
No
longer
is
it
possible
for
him
to
escape
us,
not
even
though
far-darting
Apollo
should
travail
sore,
grovelling
before
the
Father,
aegis-bearing
Zeus.
But
do
thou
now
stand
and
take
breath,
and
I
will
go
and
persuade
this
man
to
confront
thee
in
fight."
Thus
spake
Athene,
and
he
obeyed,
and
was
glad
at
heart,
and
stood
leaning
on
his
bronze-pointed
ashen-spear.
And
she
left
him
and
came
to
noble
Hector,

But
unto
him
with
grim
gaze
spake
Achilles
fleet
of
foot
:
"
Hector,
talk
not
to
me,
thou
madman,
of

As

there
is
no

nor

but
imagine

so
is
it
impossible
for

and
me

shall

Bethink
thee

thy

:
now
behoveth
it
thee
to
quit
thee
as
a
good
spearman
and
valiant
man
of
war.
No
longer
is
there
way

but
Pallas
Athene
will
straightway
subdue
thee
to
my
spear
;
and
now
in
one
hour
shalt
thou
pay

for
all
my
sorrows
for
my
friends
whom
thou
hast
slain
in
the
fury
of
thy
spear."
He
said,
and
poised
his
far-shadowing
spear
and
hurled.
And
noble
Hector
watched
the
coming
thereof
and
avoided
it

with
his
eye
on
it
he
crouched,
and
the
bronze
spear
flew
over
him,
and
fixed
itself
in
the
earth
;
but
Pallas
Athene
caught
it
up
and
gave
it
back
to
Achilles,
unknown
of
Hector
shepherd
of
hosts.
Then
Hector
spake
unto
the
noble
son
of
Peleus
:
"
Thou
hast
missed,

yet,
godlike
Achilles,
hast
thou
known

the
hour
of

thou
thoughtest

Cunning
of

art
thou
and
a
deceiver
in

that
fearing
thee
I
might

Not
as
I

thou
plant
thy

drive
it

I

Now

Then
would

if

He
said,

And
he
fell
down
in

dust,
and
noble
Achilles
spake
exultingly
:
"

Then

unto
him
Hector

:
"I
pray
thee
by
thy

dear
comrade.
But
come,
ye
sons
of
the
Achaians,
let
us
now,
singing
our
song
of
victory,
go
back
to
the
hollow
ships
and
take
with
us
our
foe.
Great
glory
have
we
won
;
we
have
slain
the
noble
Hector,
unto
whom
the
Trojans
prayed
throughout
their
city,
as
he
had
been
a
god."
He
said,
and
devised
foul
entreatment
of
noble
Hector.
The
tendons
of
both
feet
behind
he
slit
from
heel
to
ankle-joint,
and
thrust
therethrough
thongs
of
ox-hide,
and
bound
him
to
his
chariot,
leaving
his
head
to
trail.
And
when
he
had
mounted
the
chariot
and
lifted
therein
the
famous
armour,
he
lashed
his
horses
to
speed,
and
they
nothing
loth
flew
on.
And
dust
rose
around
him
that
was
dragged,
and
his
dark
hair
flowed
loose
on
either
side,
and
in
the
dust
lay
all
his
once
fair
head,
for
now
had
Zeus
given
him
over
to
his
foes
to
entreat
foully
in
his
own
native
land.
Thus
was
his
head
all
grimed
with
dust.
But
his
mother
when
she
beheld
her
son,
tore
her
hair
and
cast
far
from
her
her
shining
veil,
and
cried
aloud
with
an
exceeding
bitter
cry.
And
piteously
moaned
his
father,
and
around
them
the
folk
fell
to
crying
and
moaning
throughout
the
town.
Most
like
it
seemed
as
though
all
beetling
Ilios
were
burning
utterly
in
fire.
Scarcely
could
the
folk
keep
back
the
old
man
in
his
hot
desire
to
get
him
forth
of
the
Dardanian
gates.
For
he
besought
them
all,
casting
himself
down
in
the
mire,
and
calling
on
each
man
by
his
name
:
"
Hold,
friends,
and
though
you
love
me
leave
me
to
get
me
forth
of
the
city
alone
and
go
unto
the
ships
of
the
Achaians.
Let
me
pray
this
accursed
horror-
working
man,
if
haply
he
may
feel
shame
before
his
age-fellows
and
pity
an
old
man.

;
then
wept
and

and
I

Thus
spake
he
wailing,
and
all
the
men
of
the
city
;:
.idc
moan
with
him.
And
among
the
women
of

the
wild
lament
:

Thus
spake
she
wailing.

Achilles
have
cut
off
bold
Hector
from
the
city
by
himself
and
chased
him
to
the
plain
and
ere
this
ended
his
perilous
pride
that
possessed
him,
for
never
would
he
tarry
among
the
throng
of
men
but
ran
out
before
them
far,
yielding
place
to
no

Thus
saying
she
sped
through
the
chamber
like
one
mad,
with
beating
heart,
and
with
her
went
her
handmaidens.
But
when
she
came
to
the
battlements
and
the
throng
of
men,
she
stood
still
upon
the
wall
and
gazed,
and
beheld
him
dragged
before
the
city
:—
swift
horses
dragged
him
reck-
lessly
toward
the
hollow
ships
of
the
Achaians.
Then
dark
night
came
on
her
eyes
and
shrouded
her,
and
she
fell
back-
ward
and
gasped
forth
her
spirit.
From
off
her
head
she
shook
the
bright
attiring
thereof,
frontlet
and
net
and
woven
band,
and
veil,
the
veil
that
golden
Aphrodite
gave
her
on
the
day
when
Hector
of
the
glancing
helm
led
her
forth
of
the
house
of
Ee'tion,
having
given
bride
-
gifts
untold.
And
around
her
thronged
her
husband's
sisters
and
his
brothers'
wives,
who
held
her
up
among
them,
distraught
even
to
death.
But
when
at
last
she
came
to
herself
and
her
soul
returned
into
her
breast,
then
wailing
with
deep
sobs
she
spake
among
the
women
of
Troy
:
"
O
Hector,
woe

THUS
they
throughout
the
city
made
moan
:
but
the
Achaians
when
they
were
come
to
the
ships
and
to
the
Hellespont
were
scattered
each
to
his
own
ship
:
only
the
Myrmidons
Achilles
suffered
not
to
be
scattered,
but
spake
among
his
comrades
whose
delight
was
in
war:
"Fleet-
horsed
Myr-
midons,
my
trusty
comrades,
let
us
not
yet
unyoke
our
whole-hooved
steeds
from
their
cars,
but
with
horses
and
chariots
let
us
go
near
and
mourn
Patroklos,
for
such
is
the
honour
of
the
dead.
Then
when
we
have
our
fill
of
grievous
wailing,
we
will
unyoke
the
horses
and
all
sup
here."
He
said,
and
they
with
one
accord
made
lamentation,
and
Achilles
led
their
mourning.
So
thrice
around
the
dead
they
drave
their
well-maned
steeds,
moaning;
and
Thetis
stirred
among
them
desire
of
wailing.
Bedewed
were
the
sands
with
tears,

the
warriors'
arms;
so
great
a

they
sorrowed
for.
And
Peleus'
son
led
their
loud
wail,
laying
his
man-slaying
hands
on
his
comrade's
breast
:
"

went
down
each
man
to
his
tent
to
take
his
rest,
but
the
son
of
Peleus
upon
the
beach
of
the
sounding
sea
lay
groaning
heavily,
amid
the
host
of
Myrmidons,
in
an
open
place,
where
waves
were
breaking
on
the
shore.
Now
when
sleep
took
hold
on
him,
easing
the
cares
of
his
heart,
deep
sleep
that
fell
about
him,
(for
sore
tired
were
his
glorious
knees
with
onset
upon
Hector
toward
windy
Ilios),
then
came
there
unto
him
the
spirit
of
hapless
Patroklos,
in
all
things
like
his
living
self,
in
stature,
and
fair
eyes,
and
voice,
and
the
raiment
of
his
body
was
the
same
;
and
he
stood
above
Achilles'
head
and
spake
to
him
:
"
Thou
sleepest,
and
hast
forgotten
me,
O
Achilles.
Not
in
my
life
wast
thou
ever
unmindful
of
me,
but
in
my
death.
Bury
me
with
all
speed,
that
I
pass
the
gates
of
Hades.
Far
off
the
spirits
banish
me,
the
phantoms
of
men
outworn,
nor
suffer
me
to
mingle
with
them
beyond
the
River,
but
vainly
I
wander
along
the
wide-gated
dwelling
of
Hades
Now
give
me,
I
pray
pitifully
of
thee,
thy
hand,
for
never
more
again
shall
I
come
back
from
Hades,
when
ye
have
given
me
my
due
of
fire.
Never
among
the
living
shall
we
sit
apart
from
our
dear
comrades
and
take
counsel
together,
but
me
hath
the
harsh
fate
swallowed
up
which
was
appointed
me
even
from
my
birth.
Yea
and
thou
too
thyself,
Achilles
peer
of
gods,
beneath
the
wall
of
the
noble
Trojans
art
doomed
to
die.
Yet
one
thing
will
I
say,
?nd
charge
thee,
if
haply
thou
wilt
have
regard
thereto.
Lay
not
my
bones
apart
from
thine,
Achilles,
but
together,
even
as
we
were
nurtured
in
your
house,
when
Menoitios
brought
me
yet
a
little
one
from
Opoeis
to
your
country
by
reason
of
a
grievous
man-slaying,
on
the
day
when
I
slew
Amphidamas'
son,
not
willing
it,
in
childish
wrath
over
the
dice.
Then
took
me
the
knight
Peleus
into
his
house
and
reared
me
kindly
and
named
me
thy
squire
:
so
therefore
let
one
coffer
hide
our
bones,
[a

coffer,

Then
made

him
Achilles

"Wherefore,

with

And
Achilles
sprang
up

and
smote
his
hands
together,
and
spake
a
\v,.nl
of
woe:
"Ay
me,
there
remaineth

even
in

a
spirit
and
phantom
of

albeit

:

Patroklos

over

wailing
and
making
moan,
and
charged
me
everything
that
I
should
do,
and
wondrous
like
his
living
self
it
seemed."
Thus
said
he,
and
stirred
in
all
of
them
yearning
to
make
lament
;
and
rosy-fingered
Morn
shone
forth
on
them
while
they
still
made
moan
around
the
piteous
corpse.

where
Achilles
purposed
a
mighty
tomb
for
Patroklos
and
for
himself.
Then
when
they
had
laid
down
all
about
great
piles
of
wood,
they
sate
them
down
all
together
and
abode.
Then
straightway
Achilles
bade
the
warlike
Myrmidons
gird
on
their
arms,
and
each
yoke
the
horses
to
his
chariot
;
and
they
arose
and
put
their
armour
on,
and
mounted
their
chariots,
both
fighting
men
and
charioteers.
In
front
were
the
men
in
chariots,
and
a
cloud
of
footmen
followed
after,
numberless
;
and
in
the
midst
his
comrades
bare
Patroklos.
And
they
heaped
all
the
corpse
with
their
hair
that
they
cut
off
and
threw
thereon
;
and
behind
did
goodly
Achilles
bear
the
head,
sorrowing
;
for
a
noble
comrade
was
he
speeding
forth
unto
the
realm
of
Hades.
And
when
they
came
to
the
place
where
Achilles
had
bidden
them,
they
set
down
the
dead,
and
piled
for
him
abundant
wood.
Then
fleet-footed
noble
Achilles
bethought
him
of
one
thing
more:
standing
apart
from
the
pyre
he
shore
off
a
golden
lock,
the
lock
whose
growth
he
nursed
to
offer
unto
the
River
Spercheios,
and
sore
troubled
spake
he,
looking
forth
over
the
wine-dark
sea
:
"
Spercheios,
in
other
wise
vowed
my
father
Peleus
unto
thee
that
I
returning
thither
to
my
native
land
should
shear
my
hair
for
thee
and
offer
a
holy
hecatomb,
and
fifty
rams
should
sacrifice
there
above
thy
springs,
where
is
thy
sacred
close
and
altar
burning
spice.
So
vowed
the
old
man,
but
thou
hast
not
accom-
plished
him
his
desire.
And
now
since
I
return
not
to
my
dear
native
land,
unto
the
hero
Patroklos
I
may
give
this
hair
to
take
away."
Thus
saying
he
set
the
hair
in
the
hands
of
his
dear
comrade,
and
stirred
in
all
of
them
yearning
to
make
lament.
And
so
would
the
light
of
the
sun
have
gone
down
on
their
lamentation,
had

that
Achilles
might
not
tear
him
when
he
dragged
him.
And
over
him
Phoebus
Apollo
brought
a
dark
cloud
from
heaven
to
earth
and
covered
all
that
place
whereon
the
dead
man
lay,
lest
meanwhile
the
sun's
strength
shrivel
his
flesh
round
about
upon
his
sinews
and
limbs.
But
the
pyre
of
dead
Patroklos
kindled
not.
Then
fleet-footed
noble
Achilles
had
a
further
thought
:
standing
aside
from
the
pyre
he
prayed
to
the
two
Winds
of
North
and
West,
and
promised
them
fair
offerings,
and
pouring
large
libations
from
a
golden
cup
besought
them
to
come,
that
the
corpses
might
blaze
up
speedily
in
the
fire,
and
the
wood
make
haste
to
be
enkindled.
Then
Iris,
when
she
heard
his
prayer,
went
swiftly
with
the
message
to
the
Winds.
They
within
the
house
of
the
gusty
West
Wind
were
feasting
all
together
at
meat,
when
Iris
sped
thither,
and
halted
on
the
threshold
of
stone.
And
when
they
saw
her
with
their
eyes5
they
sprang
up
and
called
to
her
every
one
to
sit
by
him.
But
she
refused
to
sit,
and
spake
her
word
:
"
No
seat
for
me
;
I
must
go
back
to
the
streams
of
Ocean,
to
the
Ethiopians'
land
where
they
sacrifice
heca-
tombs
to
the
immortal
gods,
that
I
too
may
feast
at
their
rites.
But
Achilles
is
praying
the
North
Wind
and
the
loud
West
to
come,
and
promising
them
fair
offerings,
that
ye
may
make
the
pyre
be
kindled
whereon
lieth
Patroklos,
for
whom
all
the
Achaians
are
making
moan."
She
having
thus
said
departed,
and
they
arose
with
a
mighty
sound,
rolling
the
clouds
before
them.
And
swiftly
they
came
blowing
over
the
sea,
and
the
wave
rose
beneath
their
shrill
blast
;
and
they
came
to
deep-soiled
Troy,
and
fell
upon
the
pile,
and
loudly
roared
the
mighty
fire.
So
all

And
they
marked
the
circle
of
the
barrow,
and
set
the
foundations
thereof
around
the
pyre,
and
straightway
heaped
thereon
a
heap
of
earth.
Then
when
they
had
heaped
up
the
barrow
they
were
for
going
back.
But
Achilles
stayed
the
folk
in
that
place,
and
made
them
sit
in
wide
assembly,
and
from
his
ships
he
brought
forth
prizes,
caldrons
and
tripods,
and
horses
and
mules
and
strong
oxen,
and
fair-girdled
women,
and
grey
iron.
First
for
fleet
chariot
-racers
he
ordained
a
noble
prize,
a
woman
skilled
in
fair
handiwork
for
the
winner
to
lead
home,
and
an
eared
tripod
that
held
two-and-twenty
measures;
these
for
the
first
man
;
and
for
the
second
he
ordained
a
six-year-old
mare
unbroke,
with
a
mule
foal
in
her
womb
;
and
for
the
third
he
gave
a
goodly
caldron
yet
untouched
by
fire,
holding
four
measures,
bright
as
when
first
made
;
and
for
the
fourth
he
ordained
two
talents
of
gold
;
and
for
the
fifth
a
two-handled
urn
untouched
of
fire.
Then
he
stood
up
and
spake
a
word
among
the
Argives
:
"
Son
of
Atreus
and
ye
other
well-greaved
Achaians,
for
the
chariot-racers
these
prizes
lie
awaiting
them
in
the
lists.
If
in
some
other's
honour
we
Achaians
were
now
holding
our
games,
it
would
be
I
who
should
win
the
first
prize
and
bear
it
to
my
hut
;
for
ye
know
how
far
my
pair
of
horses
are
first
in
excellence,
for
they
are
immortal,
and
Poseidon
gave
them
to
my
father
Peleus,
and
he
again
to
me.
But
verily
I
will
abide,
I
and
my
whole-hooved
horses,
so
glorious
a
charioteer
have
they
lost,
and
one
so
kind,
who
on
their
manes
full
often
poured
smooth
oil,
when
he
had
washed
them
in
clear
water.
For
him
they
stand
and
mourn,
and
their
manes
are
trailing
on
the
ground,
and
there
stand
they
with
sorrow
at
their
hearts.
But
ye
others
throughout
the
host
get
ye
to
your
places,
whosoever
of
the
Achaians
hath
trust
in
his

and

Now
will

A

:
it

this
now
is
the
mark
fixed
by
fleet-footed
goodly
Achilles.
Wherefore
do
thou
drive
close

bear
thy
horses
and

thereon,
and
lean
thy
body
on
the
well-knit
car
slightly
to

with
voice
and

and
give

from

;
so
would
that
be
triumph
to
the

and
reproach
unto
thyself.
But,
dear
son,
be
wise
and
on
thy
guard
;
for
if
at
the
turning-post
thou
drive
past
the
rest,
there
is
none
shall
overtake
thee
from

or
pass
thee

of
all

land."
Thus
spake
Nelei'an
Nestor
and
sate
him
down
again
in
his
place,
when
he
had
told
his
son
the
sum
of
every
matter.
And
Meriones
was
the
fifth
to
make
ready
his
sleek-
coated
steeds.
Then
went
they
up
into
their
chariots,
and
cast
in
the
lots
:
and
Achilles
shook
them,
and
forth
leapt
the

and
the

as
running
without
spur.
But
Athene
was
not
unaware
of
Apollo's
guile
against
Tydeides,
and
presently
sped
after
the
shepherd
of
hosts,
and
gave
him
back
the
lash,
and
put
spirit
into
his
steeds.
Then
in
wrath
after
the
son
of
Ad-
metos
was
the
goddess
gone,
and
brake
his
steeds'
yoke,
and
the
mares
ran
sideways
off
the
course,
and
the
pole
was
twisted
to
the
ground.
And
Eumelos
was
hurled
out
of
the
car
beside
the
wheel,
and
his
elbows
and
mouth
and
nose
were
flayed,
and
his
forehead
bruised
above
his
eyebrows
;
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
his
lusty
voice
was
choked.
Then
Tydeides
held
his
whole-hooved
horses
on
one
side,
darting
far
out
before
the
rest,
for
Athene
put
spirit
into
his
steeds
and
shed
glory
on
himself.
Now
next
after
him
came
golden-haired
Menelaos
Atreus'
son.
But
Antilochos
called
to
his
father's
horses
:
"
Go
ye
too
in,

to
your
fleetest
pace.
Truly
I
nowise
bid
you
strive
with
those,
the
horses
of
wise
Tydeides,
unto
which
Athene
hath
now
given
speed,
and
shed
glory
on
their
charioteer.
But
overtake
Atreides'
horses
with
all
haste,
and
be
not
outstripped
by
them,
lest
Aithe
that
is
but
a

pour

Why
are
ye
outstripped,
brave
steeds
?
Thus
will
I
tell
you,
and
verily
it
shall
be
brought
to
pass
—
ye
will
find
no
tend-
ance
with
Nestor
shepherd
of
hosts,
but
straightway
he
will
slay
you
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
if
through
heedlessness
we
win
but
the
worse
prize.
Have
after
them
at
your
utmost
speed,
and
I
for
my
part
will
devise
a
plan
to
pass
them
in
the
strait
part
of
the
course,
and
this
shall
fail
me
not."
Thus
spake
he,
and
they
fearing
the
voice
of
the
prince
ran
swiftlier
some
little
while
;
and
presently
did
the
good
warrior
Antilochos
espy
a
strait
place
in
a
sunk
part
of
the
way.
There
was
a
rift
in
the
earth,
where
torrent
water
gathered
and
brake
part
of
the
track
away,
and
hollowed
all
the
place
;
there
drave
Menelaos,
shunning
the
encounter
of
the
wheels.

But
Antilochos

at

And

round
like

And
he
stood
upright
and
spoke
among
the
Argives
:
"
Friends,
chiefs,
and
counsellors
of
the
Argives,
is
it
I
alone
who
see
the
horses,
or
do
ye
also
?
A
new
pair
seem
to
me
now
to
be
in
front,
and
a
new
chariot-
eer
appeareth
;
the
mares
which
led
in
the
outward
course
must
have
been
thrown
out
there
in
the
plain.
For
I
saw
them
turning
first
the
hither
post,
but
now
can
see
them
no-
where,
though
my
eyes
are
gazing
everywhere
along
the
Trojan
plain.
Did
the
reins
escape
the
charioteer
so
that
he
could
not
drive
aright
round
the
post
and
failed
in
the
turn
?
There,
methinks,
must
he
have
been
cast
forth,
and
have
broken
his
chariot,
and
the
mares
must
have
left
the
course,
in
the
wildness
of
their
heart.
But
stand
up
ye
too
and
look,
for
myself
I
discern
not
certainly,
but
the
first
man
seemeth
to
me
one
of
Aitolian
race,
and
he
ruleth
among
Argives,
the
son
of
horse-taming
Tydeus,
stalwart
Diomedes."
Then
fleet
Aias
Oileus'
son
rebuked
him
in
unseemly
sort
:
"
Idomeneus,
why
art
thou
a
braggart
of
old
?
As
yet
far
off
the
high-stepping
mares
are
coursing
over
the
wide
plain.
Neither
art
thou
so
far
the
youngest
among
the
Argives,
nor
do
thy
eyes
look
so
far
the
keenliest
from
thy
head,
yet
continually
braggest
thou.
It
beseemeth
thee
not
to
be
a
braggart,
for
there
are
here
better
men.
And
the
mares
leading
are
they
that
led
before,
Eumelos'
mares,
and
he
standeth
and
holdeth
the
reins
within
the
car."
Then
wrathfully
in
answer
spake
the
chief
of
Cretans
:
"
Aias,
master
of
railing,
ill-counselled,
in
all
else
art
thou
behind
other
Argives,
for
thy
mind
is
unfriendly.
Come
then
let
us
wager
a
tripod
or
caldron,
and
make
Agamemnon
Atreus'
son
our
umpire,
which
mares
are
leading,
that
thou
mayest
pay
and
learn."
Thus
said
he,
and
straightway
fleet
Aias
Oileus'
son
arose
ILIAD

angrily
to
answer
with
harsh
words
:
and
strife
between
the
twain
would
have
gone
further,
had
not
Achilles
himself
stood
up
and
spake
a
word
:
"
No
longer
answer
each
other
with
harsh
words,
Aias
and
Idomeneus,
ill
words,
for
it
be-
seemeth
not.
Surely
ye
are
displeased
with
any
other
who
should
do
thus.
Sit
ye
in
the
concourse
and
keep
your
eyes
upon
the
horses
;
soon
they
in
zeal
for
victory
will
come
hither,
and
then
shall
ye
know
each
of
you
the
Argives'
horses,
which
follow,
and
which
lead."
He
said,
and
the
son
of
Tydeus
came
driving
up,
and
with
his
lash
smote
now
and
again
from
the
shoulder,
and
his
horses
were
stepping
high
as
they
sped
swiftly
on
their
way.
And
sprinklings
of
dust
smote
ever
the
charioteer,
and
his
chariot
overlaid
with
gold
and
tin
ran
behind
his
fleet-footed
steeds,
and
small
trace
was
there
of
the
wheel-tires
behind
in
the
fine
dust,
as
they
flew
speeding
on.
Then
he
drew
up
in
the
mid
concourse,
and
much
sweat
poured
from
the
horses'
heads
and
chests
to
the
ground.
And
Diomedes
leapt
to
earth
from
the
shining
car,
and
leant
his
lash
against
the
yoke.
Then
stalwart
Sthenelos
tarried
not,
but
promptly
took
the
prize,
and
gave
to
his
proud
comrades
the
woman
to
lead
and
the
eared
tripod
to
bear
away,
and
he
loosed
the
horses
from
the
yoke.
And
next
after
him
drave
Neleian
Antilochos
his
horses,
by
craft,
not
swiftness,
having
passed
by
Menelaos
;
yet
even
now
Menelaos
held
his
swift
steeds
hard
anigh.
As
far
as
a
horse
is
from
the
wheel,
which
draweth
his
master,
straining
with
the
car
over
the
plain
—
his
hindmost
tail-hairs
touch
the
tire,
for
the
wheel
runneth
hard
anigh
nor
is
much
space
between,
as
he
speedeth
far
over
the
plain
—
by
so
much
was
Menelaos
behind
high-born
Antilochos,
howbeit
at
first
he
was
a
whole
disk-cast
behind,
but
quickly
he
was
catching
Antilochos
up,
for
the
high
mettle
of
Agamemnon's
2
H
463
ILIAD
XXIII,
591-624.
Yea,
if
thou
shouldst
ask
some
other
greater
thing
from
my
house,
I
were
fain
to
give
it
thee
straightway,
rather
than
fall
for
ever
from
my
place
in
thy
heart,
O
fosterling
of
Zeus,
and
become
a
sinner
against
the
gods."
Thus
spake
great-hearted
Nestor's
son,
and
brought
the
rnare
and
put
her
in
the
hand
of
Menelaos.
And
his
heart
was
gladdened
as
when
the
dew
cometh
upon
the
ears
of
ripening
harvest-corn,
what
time
the
fields
are
bristling.
So
gladdened
was
thy
soul,
Menelaos,
within
thy
heart.
And
he
spake
unto
Antilochos
and
uttered
winged
words
:
"Anti-
lochos,
now
will
I
of
myself
put
away
mine
anger
against
thee,
since
no
wise
formerly
wert
thou
flighty
or
light-minded,
howbeit
now
thy
reason
was
overcome
of
youthfulness.
Another
time
be
loth
to
outwit
better
men.
Not
easily
should
another
of
the
Achaians
have
persuaded
me,
but
thou
hast
suffered
and
toiled
greatly,
and
thy
brave
father
and
brother,
for
my
sake
:
therefore
will
I
hearken
to
thy
prayer,
and
will
even
give
unto
thee
the
mare,
though
she
is
mine,
that
these
also
may
know
that
my
heart
was
never
over-
weening
or
implacable."
He
said,
and
gave
the
mare
to
Noemon
Antilochos'
com-
rade
to
lead
away,
and
then
took
the
shining
caldron.
And
Meriones
took
up
the
two
talents
of
gold
in
the
fourth
place,
as
he
had
come
in.
So
the
fifth
prize
was
left
unclaimed,
a
two-handled
cup
;
to
Nestor
gave
Achilles
this,
bearing
it
to
him
through
the
concourse
of
Argives,
and
stood
by
him
and
said
:
"
Lo
now
for
thee
too,
old
man,
be
this
a
trea-
sure,
a
memorial
of
Patroklos'
burying
;
for
no
more
shalt
thou
behold
him
among
the
Argives.
Now
give
I
thee
this
prize
unwon,
for
not
in
boxing
shalt
thou
strive,
neither
wrestle,
nor
enter
on
the
javelin
match,
nor
race
with
thy
feet
;
for
grim
old
age
already
weigheth
on
thee."
Thus
saying
he
placed
it
in
his
hand,
and
Nestor
received
ILIAD
XXIII,
625-657.
469
it
gladly,
and
spake
unto
him
winged
words
:
"
Ay,
truly
all
this,
my
son,
thou
hast
meetly
said
;
for
no
longer
are
my
limbs,
friend,
firm,
nor
my
feet,
nor
do
my
arms
at
all
swing
lightly
from
my
shoulders
either
side.
Would
that
my
youth
svere
such
and
my
force
so
firm
as
when
the
Epeians
were
burying
lord
Amarynkes
at
Buprasion,
and
his
sons
held
the
king's
funeral
games.
Then
was
no
man
found
like
me,
neither
of
the
Epeians
nor
of
the
Pylians
themselves
or
the
great-hearted
Aitolians.
In
boxing
I
overcame
Klytomedes,
son
of
Enops,
and
in
wrestling
Ankaios
of
Pleuron,
who
stood
up
against
me,
and
in
the
foot-race
I
outran
Iphiklos,
a
right
good
man,
and
with
the
spear
outthrew
Phyleus
and
Polydoros
;
only
in
the
chariot-race
the
two
sons
of
Aktor
beat
me
[by
crowding
their
horses
in
front
of
me,
jealous
for
victory,
because
the
chief
prizes
were
left
at
home.]
l
Now
they
were
twins
—
one
ever
held
the
reins,
the
reins
he
ever
held,
the
other
called
on
the
horses
with
the
lash.
Thus
was
I
once,
but
now
let
younger
men
join
in
such
feats
;
I
must
bend
to
grievous
age,
but
then
was
I
of
mark
among
heroes.
But
come
hold
funeral
for
thy
comrade
too
with
games.
This
gift
do
I
accept
with
gladness,
and
my
heart
rejoiceth
that
thou
rememberest
ever
my
friendship
to
thee
-(nor
forget
I
thee)
—
and
the
honour2
wherewith
it
is
meet
that
I
be
honoured
among
the
Achaians.
And
may
the
gods
for
this
grant
thee
due
grace."
Thus
spake
he,
and
Peleides
was
gone
down
the
full
con-
course
of
Achaians,
when
he
had
hearkened
to
all
the
thanks
of
Neleus'
son.
Then
he
ordained
prizes
of
the
violent
boxing
match
;
a
sturdy
mule
he
led
forth
and
tethered
amid
the
assembly,
a
six-year
mule
unbroken,
hardest
of
all
to
break;

Yea,
if
thou
shouldst
ask
some
other
greater
thing
from
my
house,
I
were
fain
to
give
it
thee
straightway,
rather
than
fall
for
ever
from
my
place
in
thy
heart,
O
fosterling
of
Zeus,
and
become
a
sinner
against
the
gods."
Thus
spake
great-hearted
Nestor's
son,
and
brought
the
rnare
and
put
her
in
the
hand
of
Menelaos.
And
his
heart
was
gladdened
as
when
the
dew
cometh
upon
the
ears
of
ripening
harvest-corn,
what
time
the
fields
are
bristling.
So
gladdened
was
thy
soul,
Menelaos,
within
thy
heart.
And
he
spake
unto
Antilochos
and
uttered
winged
words
:
"Anti-
lochos,
now
will
I
of
myself
put
away
mine
anger
against
thee,
since
no
wise
formerly
wert
thou
flighty
or
light-minded,
howbeit
now
thy
reason
was
overcome
of
youthfulness.
Another
time
be
loth
to
outwit
better
men.
Not
easily
should
another
of
the
Achaians
have
persuaded
me,
but
thou
hast
suffered
and
toiled
greatly,
and
thy
brave
father
and
brother,
for
my
sake
:
therefore
will
I
hearken
to
thy
prayer,
and
will
even
give
unto
thee
the
mare,
though
she
is
mine,
that
these
also
may
know
that
my
heart
was
never
over-
weening
or
implacable."
He
said,
and
gave
the
mare
to
Noemon
Antilochos'
com-
rade
to
lead
away,
and
then
took
the
shining
caldron.
And
Meriones
took
up
the
two
talents
of
gold
in
the
fourth
place,
as
he
had
come
in.
So
the
fifth
prize
was
left
unclaimed,
a
two-handled
cup
;
to
Nestor
gave
Achilles
this,
bearing
it
to
him
through
the
concourse
of
Argives,
and
stood
by
him
and
said
:
"
Lo
now
for
thee
too,
old
man,
be
this
a
trea-
sure,
a
memorial
of
Patroklos'

;

Now

placed
it
in

and
spake
a
word
among
the
Argives
:
"
Son
of
Atreus
and
ye
other
well-greaved
Achaians,
for
these
rewards
we
summon
two
men
of
the
best
to
lift
up
their
hands
to
box
amain.
He
to
whom
Apollo
shall
grant
endurance
to
the
end,
and
all
the
Achaians
acknowledge
it,
let
him
take
the
sturdy
mule
and
return
with
her
to
his
hut
;
and
the
loser
shall
take
with
him
the
two-handled
cup."
Thus
spake
he,
and
forthwith
arose
a
man
great
and
valiant
and
skilled
in
boxing,
Epeios
son
of
Panopeus,
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
sturdy
mule
and
said
aloud
:
"
Let
one
come
nigh
to
bear
off
the
two-handled
cup
;
the
mule
I
say
none
other
of
the
Achaians
shall
take
for
victory
with
his
fists,
for
I
claim
to
be
the
best
man
here.
Sufficeth
it
not
that
I
fall
short
of
you
in
battle
?
Not
possible
is
it
that
in
all
arts
a
man
be
skilled.
Thus
proclaim
I,
and
it
shall
be
accomplished:
I
will
utterly
bruise
mine
adversary's
flesh
and
break
his
bones,
so
let
his
friends
abide
together
here
to
bear
him
forth
when
vanquished
by
my
hands."
Thus
spake
he,
and
they
all
kept
deep
silence.
And
alone
arose
against
him
Euryalos,
a
godlike
man,
son
of
king
Mekisteus
the
son
of
Talaos,
Mekisteus,
who
came
on
a
time
to
Thebes
when
Oedipus
had
fallen,
to
his
burial,
and
there
he
overcame
all
the
sons
of
Kadmos.
Thus
Tydeides
famous
with
the
spear
made
ready
Euryalos
for
the
fight,
cheering
him
with
speech,
and
greatly
desired
for
him
victory.
And
first
he
cast
about
him
a
girdle,
and
next
gave
him
well-cut
thongs
of
the
hide
of
an
ox
of
the
field.
And
the
two
boxers
being
girt
went
into
the
midst
of
the
ring,
and
both
lifting
up
their
stalwart
hands
fell
to,
and
their
hands
joined
battle
grievously.
Then
was
there
terrible
grinding
of
teeth,
and
sweat
flowed
from
all
their
limbs.
And
noble
Epeios
came
on,
and

XXIIi,
725-758,
Having
thus
said
he
lifted
him,
but
Odysseus
was
not
unmindful
of
his
craft.
He
smote
deftly
from
behind
the
hollow
of
Aias'
knee,
and
loosed
his
limbs,
and
threw
him
down
backward,
and
Odysseus
fell
upon
his
chest,
and
the
folk
gazed
and
marvelled.
Then
in
his
turn
much-enduring
noble
Odysseus
tried
to
lift,
and
moved
him
a
little
from
the
ground,
but
lifted
him
not,
so
he
crooked
his
knee
within
the
other's,
and
both
fell
on
the
ground
nigh
to
each
other,
and
were
soiled
with
dust.
And
now
starting
up
again
a
third
time
would
they
have
wrestled,
had
not
Achilles
himself
arisen
and
held
them
back
:
"
No
longer
press
each
the
other,
nor
wear
you
out
with
pain.
Victory
is
with
both
;
take
equal
prizes
and
depart,
that
other
Achaians
may
contend."
Thus
spake
he,
and
they
were
fain
to
hear
and
to
obey,
and
wiped
the
dust
from
them
and
put
their
doublets
on.
Then
straightway
the
son
of
Peleus
set
forth
other
prizes
for
fleetness
of
foot
;
a
mixing-bowl
of
silver,
chased;
six
measures
it
held,
and
in
beauty
it
was
far
the
best
in
all
the
earth,
for
artificers
of
Sidon
wrought
it
cunningly,
and
men
of
the
Phoenicians
brought
it
over
the
misty
sea,
and
landed
it
in
harbour,
and
gave
it
a
gift
to
Thoas
;
and
Euneos
son
of
Jason
gave
it
to
the
hero
Patroklos
a
ransom
for
Lykaon
Priam's
son.
Now
this
cup
did
Achilles
set
forth
as
a
prize
in
honour
of
his
friend,
for
whoso
should
be
fleetest
in
speed
of
foot.
For
the
second
he
set
an
ox
great
and
very
fat,
and
for
the
last
prize
half
a
talent
of
gold.
And
he
stood
up
and
spake
a
word
among
the
Argives
:
"
Rise,
ye
who
will
essay
this
match."
Thus
spake
he,
and
straightway
arose
fleet
Aias
Oileus'
son,
and
Odysseus
of
many
wiles,
and
after
them
Nestor's
son
Antilochos,
for
he
was
best
of
all
the
youth
in
the
foot-
race.
Then
they
stood
side
by
side,
and
Achilles
showed
to
them
the
goal.
Right
eager
was
the
running
from
the
start,.

but
Ofleus'
son
forth
with
shot
to
the
front,
and
close
behind
him
came
noble
Odysseus,
as
close
as
is
a
weaving-rod
to
a
fair-girdled
woman's
breast
when
she
pulleth
it
deftly
with
her
hands,
drawing
the
spool
along
the
warp,
and
holdeth
the
rod
nigh
her
breast
—
so
close
ran
Odysseus
behind
Aias
and
trod
in
his
footsteps
or
ever
the
dust
had
settled
there,
and
on
his
head
fell
the
breath
of
noble
Odysseus
as
he
ran
ever
lightly
on,
and
all
the
Achaians
applauded
his
struggle
for
the
victory
and
called
on
him
as
he
laboured
hard.
But
when
they
were
running
the
last
part
of
the
course,
forth-
with
Odysseus
prayed
in
his
soul
to
bright-eyed
Athene
:
"
Hearken,
goddess,
come
thou
a
good
helper
of
my
feet."
Thus
prayed
he,
and
Pallas
Athene
hearkened
to
him,
and
made
his
limbs
feel
light,
both
feet
and
hands.
But
when
they
were
now
nigh
darting
on
the
prize,
then
Aias
slipped
as
he
ran,
for
Athene
marred
his
race,
where
filth
was
strewn
from
the
slaughter
of
loud-bellowing
oxen
that
fleet
Achilles
slew
in
honour
of
Patroklos
:
and
Aias'
mouth
and
nostrils
were
filled
with
that
filth
of
oxen.
So
much-enduring
noble
Odysseus,
as
he
came
in
first,
took
up
the
mixing-bowl,
and
famous
Aias
took
the
ox.
And
he
stood
holding
in
his
hand
the
horn
of
the
ox
of
the
field,
sputtering
away
the
filth,
and
spake
among
the
Argives
:
"
Out
on
it,
it
was
the
goddess
who
marred
my
running,
she
who
from
of
old
like
a
mother
standeth
by
Odysseus'
side
and
helpeth
him."
So
spake
he,
but
they
all
laughed
pleasantly
to
behold
him.
Then
Antilochos
smiling
bore
off
the
last
prize,
and
spake
his
word
among
the
Argives
:
"
Friends,
ye
will
all
bear
me
witness
when
I
say
that
even
herein
also
the
immortals
favour
elder
men.
For
Aias
is
a
little
older
than
I,
but
Odysseus
of
an
earlier
generation
and
earlier
race
of
men.
A
green
old
age
is
his,
they
say,
and
hard
were
it
for
any
Achaian
to
rival
him
in
speed,
save
only
Achilles."
474
ILIAD
XXni,
793-820.
Thus
spake
he,
and
gave
honour
to
the
fleet
son
of
Peleus.
And
Achilles
answered
him
and
said
:
"
Antilochos,
not
unheeded
shall
thy
praise
be
given;
a
half
-talent
of
gold
I
will
give
thee
over
and
above."
He
said,
and
set
it
in
his
hands,
and
Antilochos
received
it
gladly.
f1
Then
Peleus'
son
brought
a
long-shadowed
spear
into
the
ring
and
laid
it
there,
and
a
shield
and
helmet,
the
arms
of
Sarpedon
whereof
Patroklos
spoiled
him.
And
he
stood
up
and
spake
a
word
among
the
Argives
:
"To
win
these
arms
we
bid
two
warriors
of
the
best
put
on
their
armour
and
take
flesh-cleaving
bronze
to
make
trial
of
each
other
before
the
host
whether
of
the
two
shall
first
reach
the
other's
fair
flesh
and
touch
the
inward
parts
through
armour
and
dark
blood.
To
him
will
I
give
this
silver-studded
sword,
a
goodly
Thracian
sword
that
I
took
from
Asteropaios
;
and
these
arms
let
both
bear
away
to
hold
in
common,
and
a
fair
feast
will
we
set
before
them
in
the
huts."
Thus
spake
he,
and
then
arose
Telamon's
son
great
Aias,
and
up
rose
Tydeus'
son,
stalwart
Diomedes.
So
when
on
either
side
the
assembly
they
had
armed
them,
they
met
together
in
the
midst
eager
for
battle,
with
terrible
gaze
;
and
wonder
fell
on
all
the
Achaians.
But
when
they
were
now
nigh
in
onset
on
each
other,
thrice
they
came
on
and
thrice
drew
nigh
to
smite.
Then
Aias
smote
on
the
round
shield,
but
pierced
not
to
the
flesh,
for
the
breast-plate
within
kept
off
the
spear.
But

son
of
Tydeus

his
great
shield

"There

kept
ever
aiming
at
the
neck
with
the
point
of
his
bright
spear.
Then
fearing
for
Aias
the
Achaians
bade
them
cease
and
each
take
equal
prize.
But
to
Tydeus'
son
the
hero
gave
the
great
sword,
bringing
it
with
its
scabbard
and
well-
cut
belt.
Then
the
son
of
Peleus
set
an
unwrought
metal
mass
which
anciently
the
mighty
Ee'tion
was
wont
to
whirl
;
but
him
fleet
noble
Achilles
slew,
and
brought
the
mass
in
his
ships
with
his
other
possessions.
And
he
stood
up
and
spake
a
word
among
the
Argives
:
"
Rise,
ye
who
will
essay
this
match.
The
winner
of
this,
even
though
his
rich
fields
be
very
far
remote,
will
have
it
for
use
five
rolling
years,
for
his
shepherd
or
ploughman
will
not
for
want
of
iron
have
to
go
into
the
town,
but
this
will
give
it
them."
Thus
said
he,
and
then
arose
warlike
Polypoites,
and
the
valiant
strength
of
godlike
Leonteus,
and
Aias
son
of
Tela-
mon
and
noble
Epeios.
And
they
stood
in
order,
and
noble
Epeios
took
the
weight,
and
whirled
and
flung
it
;
and
all
the
Achaians
laughed
to
see
it.
Then
next
Leonteus,
of
the
stock
of
Ares,
threw
;
and
thirdly
great
Aias
Telamon's
son
hurled
it
from
his
stalwart
hand,
and
overpassed
the
marks
of
all.
But
when
warlike
Polypoites
took
the
mass
he
flung
it
as
far
as
a
herdsman
flingeth
his
staff,
when
it
flieth
whirling
through
herds
of
kine
;
—
so
far
cast
he
beyond
all
the
space,
and
the
people
shouted
aloud.
And
the
comrades
of
strong
Polypoites
arose
and
bare
the
king's
prize
to
the
hollow
ships.
Then
for
the
archers
he
set
a
prize
of
dark
iron
—
ten
double-headed
axes
he
set,
and
ten
single
;
and
set
up
the
mast
of
a
dark-prowed
ship
far
off
in
the
sands,
and
bound
a
pigeon
thereto
by
the
foot
with
a
fine
cord,
and
bade
shoot
thereat
:
—
"
Whosoever
shall
hit
the
pigeon
let
him
take
all
the
double
axes
home
with
him,
and
whoso
shall
miss
the

bird
but
hit
the
cord,
he
shall
take
the
single,
since
his
shot
is
worse.'5
Thus
spake
he,
and
then
arose
the
strength
of
the
chief
Teukros,
and
Meriones
arose,
Idomeneus'
brave
brother
ic
arms.
And
they
took
lots
and
shook
them
in
a
brazen
helm,
and
Teukros
drew
the
first
place
by
lot.
Forthwith
he
shot
an
arrow
with
power,
but
made
no
vow
to
offer
a
famous
hecatomb
of
firstling
lambs
to
the
Lord
of
archery.
The
bird
he
missed
—
Apollo
grudged
him
that
—
but
struck
the
cord
beside
its
foot,
where
the
bird
was
tied,
and
the
keen
dart
cut
the
cord
clean
away.
Then
the
bird
shot
up
toward
heaven,
and
the
cord
hung
loose
toward
earth;
and
the
Achaians
shouted.
Then
Meriones
made
haste
and
took
from
Teukros'
hand
the
bow
;
—
an
arrow
he
had
ready,
while
the
other
aimed
—
and
vowed
withal
to
far-darting
Apollo
a
famous
hecatomb
of
firstling
lambs.
High
up
under
the
clouds
he
saw
the
pigeon
;
there,
as
she
circled
round,
he
struck
her
in
the
midst
beneath
her
wing,
and
right
through
her
went
the
dart,
and
fell
back
and
fixed
itself
in
the
ground
before
Meriones'
foot
;
but
the
bird
lighting
on
the
mast
of
the
dark-prowed
ship
hung
down
her
neck,
and
her
feathered
pinions
drooped.
And
quickly
life
fled
from
her
limbs,
and
she
fell
far
down
from
the
mast
;
and
the
folk
looked
on
and
marvelled.
And
Meriones
took
up
all
the
ten
double
axes,
and
Teukros
bare
the
single
to
the
hollow
ships.]
Then
Peleus'
son
brought
and
set
in
the
ring
a
far-
shadowing
spear
and
a
caldron
that
knew
not
the
fire,
an
ox's
worth,
embossed
with
flowers
;
and
men
that
were
casters
of
the
javelin
arose
up.
There
rose
Atreus'
son
wide-ruling
Agamemnon,
and
Meriones,
Idomeneus'
brave
squire.
And
swift
-footed
noble
Achilles
spake
among
them
:
"
Son
of
Atreus,
for
that
we
know
how
far
thou
excellest
all,
and
how
far
the
first
thou
art
in
the
might
of
thy
throw,
take
thou

prize
with
thee
to
the
hollow
ships,
and
to
the
hero
Meriones
let
us
give
the
spear,
if
thou
art
willing
in
thy
heart
:
thus
I
at
least
advise."
Thus
spake
he,
nor
disregarded
him
Agamemnon
king
of
men.
So
to
Meriones
he
gave
the
spear
of
bronze,
but
to
the
herald
Talthybios
the
hero
gave
the
goodliest
prize.
BOOK
XXIV.
How
the
body
of
Hector
was
ransomed,
and
of
his
funeral.
THEN
the
assembly
was
broken
up,
and
the
tribes
were
scat-
tered
to
betake
them
each
to
their
own
swift
ships.
The
rest
bethought
them
of
supper
and
sweet
sleep
to
have
joy
thereof;
but
Achilles
wept,
remembering
his
dear
comrade,
nor
did
sleep
that
conquereth
all
take
hold
on
him,
but
he
kept
turning
him
to
this
side
and
to
that,
yearning
for
Patro-
klos'
manhood
and
excellent
valour,
and
all
the
toils
he
achieved
with
him
and
the
woes
he
bare,
cleaving
the
battles
of
men
and
the
grievous
waves.
As
he
thought
thereon
he
shed
big
tears,
now
lying
on
his
side,
now
on
his
back,
now
on
his
face
;
and
then
anon
he
would
arise
upon
his
feet
and
roam
wildly
beside
the
beach
of
the
salt
sea.
Nor
would
he
be
unaware
of
the
Dawn
when
she
arose
over
the
sea
and
shores.
But
when
he
had
yoked
the
swift
steeds
to
his
car
he
would
bind
Hector
behind
his
chariot
to
drag
him
withal
;
and
having
thrice
drawn
him
round
the
barrow
of
the
dead
son
of
Menoitios
he
rested
again
in
his
hut,
and
left
Hector
lying
stretched
on
his
face
in
the
dust.
But
Apollo
kept
away
all
defacement
from
his
flesh,
for
he
had
pity
on
him
even
in
death,
and
covered
him
all
with
his
golden
aegis,
that
Achilles
might
not
tear
him
when
he
dragged
him.
Thus
Achilles
in
his
anger
entreated
noble
Hector
shame-
fully;
but
the
blessed
gods
when
they
beheld
him
pitied
him,

479
and
urged
the
clear-sighted
slayer
of
Argus
to
steal
the
corpse
away.
So
to
all
the
others
seemed
it
good,
yet
not
to
Hera
or
Poseidon
or
the
bright-eyed
Maiden,
but
they
continued
as
when
at
the
beginning
sacred
Ilios
became
hateful
to
them,
and
Priam
and
his
people,
by
reason
of
the
sin
of
Alexandros
in
that
he
contemned
those
goddesses
when
they
came
to
his
steading,
and
preferred
her
who
brought
him
deadly
lustfulness.
But
when
the
twelfth
morn
from
that
day
arose,
then
spake
among
the
Immortals
Phoebus
Apollo
:
"
Hard
of
heart
are
ye,
O
gods,
and
cruel.
Hath
Hector
never
burnt
for
you
thigh-bones
of
unblemished
bulls
and
goats
?
Now
have
ye
not
taken
heart
to
rescue
even
his
corpse
for
his
wife
to
look
upon
and
his
mother
and
his
child
and
his
father
Priam
and
his
people,
who
speedily
would
burn
him
in
the
fire
and
make
his
funeral.
But
fell
Achilles,
O
gods,
ye
are
fain
to
abet,
whose
mind
is
nowise
just
nor
the
purpose
in
his
breast
to
be
turned
away,
but
he
is
cruelly
minded
as
a
lion
that
in
great
strength
and
at
the
bidding
of
his
proud
heart
goeth
forth
against
men's
flocks
to
make
his
meal
;
even
thus
Achilles
hath
cast
out
pity,
neither
hath
he
shame,
that
doth
both
harm
and
profit
men
greatly.
It
must
be
that
many
a
man
lose
even
some
dearer
one
than
was
this,
a
brother
of
the
same
womb
born
or
perchance
a
son
;
yet
bringeth
he
his
wailing
and
lamentation
to
an
end,
for
an
enduring
soul
have
the
Fates
given
unto
men.
But
Achilles
after
bereaving
noble
Hector
of
his
life
bindeth
him
behind
his
horses
and
draggeth
him
around
the
tomb
of
his
dear
comrade
:
not,
verily,
is
that
more
honourable
or
better
for
him.
Let
him
take
heed
lest
we
wax
wroth
with
him,
good
man
though
he
be,
for
in
his
fury
he
is
entreating
shamefully
the
senseless
clay."
Then
in
anger
spake
unto
him
white-armed
Hera
:
"
Even
thus
mightest
thou
speak,
O
Lord
of
the
silver
bow,
if
ye
are

to
give
equal
honour
to
Achilles
and
to
Hector.
Hector
is
but
a
mortal
and
was
suckled
at
a
woman's
breast,
but
Achilles
is
child
of
a
goddess
whom
I
myself
bred
up
and
reared
and
gave
to
a
man
to
be
his
wife,
even
to
Peleus
who
was
dearest
of
all
men
to
the
Immortals'
heart.
And
all
ye
gods
came
to
her
bridal,
and
thou
among
them
wert
feasting
with
thy
lyre,
O
lover
of
ill
company,
faithless
ever."
Then
to
her
in
answer
spake
Zeus
who
gathereth
the
clouds
:
"
Hera,
be
not
wroth
utterly
with
the
gods
:
for
these
men's
honour
is
not
to
be
the
same,
yet
Hector
also
was
dearest
to
the
gods
of
all
mortals
that
are
in
Ilios.
So
was
he
to
me
at
least,
for
nowise
failed
he
in
the
gifts
I
loved.
Never
did
my
altar
lack
seemly
feast,
drink-offering
and
the
steam
of
sacrifice,
even
the
honour
that
falleth
to
our
due.
But
verily
we
will
say
no
more
of
stealing
away
brave
Hector,
for
it
cannot
be
hidden
from
Achilles,
for
his
mother
abideth
ever
nigh
to
him
night
and
day.
But
I
were
fain
that
some
one
of
the
gods
would
call
Thetis
to
come
near
to
me,
that
I
may
speak
unto
her
a
wise
word,
so
that
Achilles
may
take
gifts
from
Priam
and
give
Hector
back."
Thus
spake
he,
and
airy-footed
Iris
sped
forth
upon
the
errand
and
between
Samothrace
and
rocky
Imbros
leapt
into
the
black
sea,
and
the
waters
closed
above
her
with
a
noise.
And
she
sped
to
the
bottom
like
a
weight
of
lead
that
mounted
on
horn
of
a
field-ox
goeth
down
bearing
death
to
ravenous
fishes.
And
she
found
Thetis
in
a
hollow
cave
;
about
her
sat
gathered
other
goddesses
of
the
sea,
and
she
in
their
midst
was
wailing
for
the
fate
of
her
noble
son
who
must
perish
in
deep-soiled
Troy,
far
from
his
native
land.
And
standing
near,
fleet-footed
Iris
spake
to
her
:
"
Rise,
Thetis
;
Zeus
of
immortal
counsels
calleth
thee."
And
to
her
made
answer
Thetis
the
silver-footed
goddess
:

Wherefore
biddeth
me
that
mighty
god
?
I

mingling
among
the
Immortals,
for
I
have
countless
woes
at
heart.
Yet
go
I,
nor
shall
his
word
be
in
vain,
whatsoever
he
saith."
Thus
having
said
the
noble
goddess
took
to
her
a
dark-
hued
robe,
no
blacker
raiment
was
there
found
than
that.
Then
she
went
forth,
and
wind-footed
swift
Iris
led
the
way
before
her,
and
around
them
the
surge
of
the
sea
was
sun-
dered.
And
when
they
had
come
forth
upon
the
shore
they
sped
up
to
heaven,
and
found
the
far-seeing
son
of
Kronos,
and
round
him
sat
gathered
all
the
other
blessed
gods
that
are
for
ever.
Then
she
sat
down
beside
father
Zeus,
and
Athene
gave
her
place.
And
Hera
set
a
fair
golden
cup
in
her
hand
and
cheered
her
with
words,
and
Thetis
drank,
and
gave
back
the
cup.
Then
began
speech
to
them
the
father
of
gods
and
men:
"Thou
art
come
to
Olympus,
divine
Thetis,
in
thy
sorrow,
with
violent
grief
at
thy
heart
;
I
know
it
of
myself.
Nevertheless
will
I
tell
thee
wherefore
I
called
thee
hither.
Nine
days
hath
dispute
arisen
among
the
Im-
mortals
concerning
the
corpse
of
Hector
and
Achilles
waster
of
cities.
Fain
are
they
to
send
clear-sighted
Argeiphontes
to
steal
the
body
away,
but
now
hear
what
glory
I
accord
herein
to
Achilles,
that
I
may
keep
through
times
to
come
thy
honour
and
good
will.
Go
with
all
speed
to
the
host
and
bear
to
thy
son
my
bidding.
Say
to
him
that
the
gods
are
displeased
at
him,
and
that
I
above
all
Immortals
am
wroth,
because
with
furious
heart
he
holdeth
Hector
at
the
beaked
ships
and
hath
not
given
him
back,
if
haply
he
may
fear
me
and
give
Hector
back.
But
I
will
send
Iris
to
great-hearted
Priam
to
bid
him
go
to
the
ships
of
the
Achaians
to
ransom
his
dear
son,
and
carry
gifts
to
Achilles
that
may
gladden
his
heart."
Thus
spake
he,
and
Thetis
the
silver-footed
goddess
was
not
disobedient
to
his
word,
and
sped
darting
upon
her
way

down
from
the
peaks
of
Olympus.
And
she
came
to
her
son's
hut
;
there
found
she
him
making
grievous
moan,
and
his
dear
comrades
round
were
swiftly
making
ready
and
furnish-
ing
their
early
meal,
and
a
sheep
great
and
fleecy
was
being
sacrificed
in
the
hut.
Then
his
lady-mother
sate
her
down
close
beside
him,
and
stroked
him
with
her
hand
and
spake
to
him
by
his
name
:
"
My
child,
how
long
with
lamentation
and
woe
wilt
thou
devour
thine
heart,
taking
thought
of
neither
food
nor
rest
?
good
were
even
a
woman's
embrace,
for
not
long
shalt
thou
be
left
alive
to
me
;
already
death
and
forceful
fate
are
standing
nigh
thee.
But
hearken
forthwith
unto
me,
for
I
am
the
messenger
of
Zeus
to
thee.
He
saith
that
the
gods
are
displeased
at
thee,
and
that
himself
above
all
Immortals
is
wroth,
because
with
furious
heart
thou
boldest
Hector
at
the
beaked
ships
and
hast
not
given
him
back.
But
come
restore
him,
and
take
ransom
for
the
dead."
Then
to
her
in
answer
spake
fleet-footed
Achilles
:
"So
be
it
:
whoso
bringeth
ransom
let
him
take
back
the
dead,
if
verily
with
heart's
intent
the
Olympian
biddeth
it
himself."
So
they
in
the
assembly
of
the
ships,
mother
and
son,
spake
to
each
other
many
winged
words.
But
the
son
of
Kronos
thus
bade
Iris
go
to
holy
Ilios
:
"Go
forth,
fleet
Iris,
leave
the
abode
of
Olympus
and
bear
my
message
within
Ilios
to
great-hearted
Priam
that
he
go
to
the
ships
of
the
Achaians
and
ransom
his
dear
son
and
carry
gifts
to
Achilles
that
may
gladden
his
heart
;
let
him
go
alone,
and
no
other
man
of
the
Trojans
go
with
him.
Only
let
some
elder
herald
attend
on
him
to
guide
the
mules
and
smooth-
wheeled
waggon
and
carry
back
to
the
city
the
dead
mar»
whom
noble
Achilles
slew.
Let
not
death
be
in
his
thought
nor
any
fear;
such
guide
will
we
give
unto
him,
even
the
slayer
of
Argus,
who

Achilles.
And
when
he
shall
have
led
him
within
the
hut,
neither
shall
Achilles
himself
slay
him
nor
suffer
any
other
herein,
for
not
senseless
is
he
or
unforeseeing
or
wicked,
but
with
all
courtesy
he
will
spare
a
suppliant
man."
Thus
spake
he,
and
airy-footed
Iris
sped
forth
upon
the
errand.
And
she
came
to
the
house
of
Priam,
and
found
therein
crying
and
moan.
His
children
sitting
around
their
father
within
the
court
were
bedewing
their
raiment
with
their
tears,
and
the
old
man
in
their
midst
was
close
wrapped
all
over
in
his
cloak
;
and
on
his
head
and
neck
was
much
mire
that
he
had
gathered
in
his
hands
as
he
grovelled
upon
the
earth.
And
his
daughters
and
his
sons'
wives
were
wailing
throughout
the
house,
bethinking
them
of
all
those
valiant
men
who
had
lost
their
lives
at
the
hands
of
the
Argives
and
were
lying
low.
And
the
messenger
of
Zeus
stood
beside
Priam
and
spake
softly
unto
him,
and
trembling
came
upon
his
limbs
:
"
Be
of
good
cheer
in
thy
heart,
O
Priam
son
of
Dardanos,
and
be
not
dismayed
for
anything,
for
no
evil
come
I
hither
to
forebode
to
thee,
but
with
good
will.
I
am
the
messenger
of
Zeus
to
thee,
who,
though
he
be
afar
off,
hath
great
care
and
pity
for
thee.
The
Olym-
pian
biddeth
thee
ransom
noble
Hector
and
carry
gifts
to
Achilles
that
may
gladden
his
heart
:
go
thou
alone,
let
none
other
of
the
Trojans
go
with
thee.
Only
let
some
elder
herald
attend
on
thee
to
guide
the
mules
and
the
smooth-wheeled
waggon
to
carry
back
to
the
city
the
dead
man
whom
noble
Achilles
slew.
Let
not
death
be
in
thy
thought,
nor
any
fear
;
such
guide
shall
go
with
thee,
even
the
slayer
of
Argus,
who
shall
lead
thee
until
his
leading
bring
thee
to
Achilles.
And
when
he
shall
have
led
thee
into
the
hut,
neither
shall
Achilles
himself
slay
thee
nor
suffer
any
other
herein,
for
not
senseless
is
he
or
unforeseeing
or
wicked,
but
with
all
courtesy
he
will
spare
a
suppliant
man."

Thus
having
spoken
fleet
Iris
departed
from
him
;
ana
he
bade
his
sons
make
ready
the
smooth
-
wheeled
mule
waggon,
and
bind
the
wicker
carnage
thereon.
And
himself
he
went
down
to
his
fragrant
chamber,
of
cedar
wood,
high-
roofed,
that
held
full
many
jewels
:
and
to
Hekabe
his
wife
he
called
and
spake
:
"
Lady,
from
Zeus
hath
an
Olympian
messenger
come
to
me,
that
I
go
to
the
ships
of
the
Achaians
and
ransom
my
dear
son,
and
carry
gifts
to
Achilles
that
may
gladden
his
heart.
Come
tell
me
how
seemeth
it
to
thy
mind,
for
of
myself
at
least
my
desire
and
heart
bid
me
mightily
to
go
thither
to
the
ships
and
enter
the
wide
camp
of
the
Achaians."
Thus
spake
he,
but
his
wife
lamented
aloud
and
made
answer
unto
him
:
"
Woe
is
me,
whither
is
gone
thy
mind
whereby
aforetime
thou
wert
famous
among
stranger
men
and
among
them
thou
rulest?
How
art
thou
fain
to
go
alone
to
the
ships
of
the
Achaians,
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
hath
slain
full
many
of
thy
brave
sons
?
of
iron
verily
is
thy
heart.
For
if
he
light
on
thee
and
behold
thee
with
his
eyes,
a
savage
and
ill-trusted
man
is
this,
and
he
will
not
pity
thee,
neither
reverence
thee
at
all.
Nay,
now
let
us
sit
in
the
hall
and
make
lament
afar
off.
Even
thus
did
forceful
Fate
erst
spin
for
Hector
with
her
thread
at
his
beginning,
when
I
bare
him,
even
I,
that
he
should
glut
fleet-footed
dogs,
far
from
his
parents,
in
the
dwelling
of
a
violent
man
whose
inmost
vitals
1
were
fain
to
fasten
and
feed
upon
;
then
would
his
deeds
against
my
son
be
paid
again
to
him,
for
not
playing
the
coward
was
he
slain
of
him,
but
championing
the
men
and
deep
-bosomed
women
of
Troy,
neither
bethought
he
him
of
shelter
or
of
flight."
Then
to
her
in
answer
spake
the
old
man
godlike
Priam
:
"
Stay
me
not,
for
I
am
fain
to
go,
neither

ill
boding
in
my
halls,
for
thou
wilt
not
change
my
mind.
Were
it
some
other
and
a
child
of
earth
that
bade
me
this,
whether
some
seer
or
of
the
priests
that
divine
from
sacrifice,
then
would
we
declare
it
false
and
have
no
part
therein
;
but
now,
since
I
have
heard
the
voice
of
the
goddess
myself
and
looked
upon
her
face,
I
will
go
forth,
and
her
word
shall
not
be
void.
And
if
it
be
my
fate
to
die
by
the
ships
of
the
mail-clad
Achaians,
so
would
I
have
it
;
let
Achilles
slay
me
with
all
speed,
when
once
I
have
taken
in
my
arms
my
son,
and
have
satisfied
my
desire
with
moan."
He
spake,
and
opened
fair
lids
of
chests
wherefrom
he
chose
twelve
very
goodly
women's
robes
and
twelve
cloaks
of
single
fold
and
of
coverlets
a
like
number
and
of
fair
sheets,
and
of
doublets
thereupon.
And
he
weighed
and
brought
forth
talents
of
gold
ten
in
all,
and
two
shining
tripods
and
four
caldrons,
and
a
goblet
exceeding
fair
that
men
of
Thrace
had
given
him
when
he
went
thither
on
an
embassy,
a
chattel
of
great
price,
yet
not
that
even
did
the
old
man
grudge
from
his
halls,
for
he
was
exceeding
fain
at
heart
to
ransom
his
dear
son.
Then
he
drave
out
all
the
Trojans
from
the
colonnade,
chiding
them
with
words
of
rebuke
:
"
Begone,
ye
that
dishonour
and
do
me
shame
!
Have
ye
no
mourning
of
your
own
at
home
that
ye
come
to
vex
me
here
?
Think
ye
it
a
small
thing
that
Zeus
Kronos'
son
hath
given
me
this
sorrow,
to
lose
him
that
was
the
best
man
of
my
sons
?
Nay,
but
ye
too
shall
feel
it,
for
easier
far
shall
ye
be
to
the
Achaians
to
slay
now
he
is
dead.
But
for
me,
ere
I
behold
with
mine
eyes
the
city
sacked
and
wasted,
let
me
go
down
into
the
house
of
Hades."
He
said,
and
with
his
staff
chased
forth
the
men,
and
they
went
forth
before
the
old
man
in
his
haste.
Then
he
called
unto
his
sons,
chiding
Helenos
and
Paris
and

and
Pammon
and
Antiphonos,
and

loud
war-cry,
and
De'iphobos
and
Hippothoos
and
proud
Dios
;
nine
were
they
whom
the
old
man
called
and
bade
unto
him
:
"
Haste
ye,
ill
sons,
my
shame
;
would
that
ye
all
in
Hector's
stead
had
been
slain
at
the
swift
ships
!
Woe
is
me
all
unblest,
since
I
begat
sons
the
best
men
in
wide
Troy-land,
but
none
of
them
is
left
for
me
to
claim,
neither
godlike
Mestor,
nor
Troilos
with
his
chariot
of
war,
nor
Hector
who
was
a
god
among
men,
neither
seemed
he
as
the
son
of
a
mortal
man
but
of
a
god
:
—
all
these
hath
Ares
slain,
and
here
are
my
shames
all
left
to
me,
false-tongued,
light-heeled,
the
heroes
of
the
dance,
plunderers
of
your
own
people's
sheep
and
kids.
Will
ye
not
make
me
ready
a
wain
with
all
speed,
and
lay
all
these
thereon,
that
we
get
us
forward
on
our
way
?
"
Thus
spake
he,
and
they
fearing
their
father's
voice
brought
forth
the
smooth-running
mule
chariot,
fair
and
new,
and
bound
the
body
thereof
on
the
frame
;
and
from
its
peg
they
took
down
the
mule
yoke,
a
boxwood
yoke
with
knob
well
fitted
with
guiding-rings
;
and
they
brought
forth
the
yoke-band
of
nine
cubits
with
the
yoke.
The
yoke
they
set
firmly
on
the
polished
pole
on
the
rest
at
the
end
thereof,
and
slipped
the
ring
over
the
upright
pin,
which
with
three
turns
of
the
band
they
lashed
to
the
knob,
and
then
belayed
it
close
round
the
pole
and
turned
the
tongue
thereunder.
Then
they
brought
from
the
chamber
and
heaped
on
the
polished
wain
the
countless
ransom
of
Hector's
head,
and
yoked
strong-hooved
harness
mules,
which
on
a
time
the
Mysians
gave
to
Priam,
a
splendid
gift.
But
to
Priam's
car
they
yoked
the
horses
that
the
old
man
kept
for
his
use
and
reared
at
the
polished
crib.
Thus
in
the
high
palace
were
Priam
and
the
herald
letting
yoke
their
cars,
with
wise
thoughts
at
their
hearts,
when
nigh
them
came

sweet

in
her
right
hand
in
a
golden
cup
that
they
might
make
libation
ere
they
went.
And
she
stood
before
the
horses
and
spake
a
word
to
Priam
by
name
:
"
Lo
now
make
libation
to
father
Zeus
and
pray
that
thou
mayest
come
back
home
from
among
the
enemy,
since
thy
heart
speedeth
thee
forth
to
the
ships,
though
fain
were
I
thou
wentest
not.
And
next
pray
to
Kronion
of
the
Storm-cloud,
the
god
of
Ida,
that
beholdeth
all
Troy-land
beneath,
and
ask
of
him
a
bird
of
omen,
even
the
swift
messenger
that
is
dearest
of
all
birds
to
him
and
of
mightiest
strength,
to
appear
upon
thy
right,
that
seeing
the
sign
with
thine
own
eyes
thou
mayest
go
in
trust
thereto
unto
the
ships
of
the
fleet-horsed
Danaans.
But
if
far-seeing
Zeus
shall
not
grant
unto
thee
his
messenger,
I
at
least
shall
not
bid
thee
on
to
go
among
the
ships
of
the
Achaians
how
fain
soever
thou
mayest
be."
Then
answered
and
spake
unto
her
godlike
Priam
:
"Lady
I
will
not
disregard
this
hest
of
thine,
for
good
it
is
to
lift
up
hands
to
Zeus,
if
haply
he
will
have
pity."
Thus
spake
the
old
man,
and
bade
a
house-dame
that
served
him
pour
pure
water
on
his
hands
;
and
she
came
near
to
serve
him
with
water
in
a
ewer
to
wash
withal.
And
when
he
had
washed
his
hands
he
took
a
goblet
from
his
wife:
then
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
court
and
prayed
and
poured
forth
wine
as
he
looked
up
to
heaven,
and
spake
a
word
aloud
:
"
Father
Zeus
that
bearest
sway
from
Ida,
most
glorious
and
most
great,
grant
that
I
find
welcome
and
pity
under
Achilles'
roof,
and
send
a
bird
of
omen,
even
the
swift
messenger
that
is
dearest
of
all
birds
to
thee
and
of
mightiest
strength,
to

that
seeing

sign
with
mine
own
eyes
1
may
go
trusting
therein
unto
the
ships
of
the
fleet-horsed
Danaans."
Thus
spake
he
praying,
and
Zeus
of
wise
counsels
heark-
ened
unto
him,
and
straightway
sent
forth
an
eagle,

the

oi
some
rich

high-roofed

so
wide
were
his
wings
either
way
;
and
he
appeared
to
them
speeding
on
the
right
hand
above
the
city.
And
when
they
saw
the
eagle
they
rejoiced
and
all
their
hearts
were
glad
within
their
breasts.
Then
the
old
man
made
haste
to
go
up
into
his
car,
and
drave
forth
from
the
doorway
and
the
echoing
portico.
In
front
the
mules
drew
the
four-wheeled
wain,
and
wise
Tdaios
drave
them
;
behind
came
the
horses
which
the
old
man
urged
with
the
lash
at
speed
along
the
city
:
and
his
friends
all
followed
lamenting
loud
as
though
he
were
faring
to
his
death.
And
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
city
and
were
now
on
the
plain,
then
went
back
again
to
Ilios
his
sons
and
marriage
kin.
But
the
two
coming
forth
upon
the
plain
were
not
unbeheld
of
far-seeing
Zeus.
But
he
looked
upon
the
old
man
and
had
compassion
on
him,
and
straightway
spake
unto
Hermes
his
dear
son
:
"
Hermes,
since
unto
thee
especially
is
it
dear
to
companion
men,
and
thou
hearest
whomsoever
thou
wilt,
go
forth
and
so
guide
Priam
to
the
hollow
ships
of
the
Achaians
that
no
man
behold
or
be
aware
of
him,
among
all
the
Danaans1
host,
until
he
come
to
the
son
of
Peleus."
Thus
spake
he,
and
the
Messenger,
the
slayer
of
Argus,
was
not
disobedient
unto
his
word.
Straightway
beneath
his
feet
he
bound
on
his
fair
sandals,
golden,
divine,
that
bare
him
over
the
wet
sea
and
over
the
boundless
land
with
the
breath-
ings
of
the
wind.
And
he
took
up
his
wand
wherewith
he
entranceth
the
eyes
of
such
men
as
he
will,
and
others
he
likewise
waketh
out
of
sleep
:
this
did
the
strong
slayer
of
Argus
take
in
his
hand,
and
flew.
And
quickly
came
he
to
Troy-land
and
the
Hellespont,
and
went
on
his
way

blance
as
a
young
man
that
is
a
prince,
with
the
new
down
on
his
chin,
as
when
the
youth
of
men
is
the
comeliest.
Now
the
others,
when
they
had
driven
beyond
the
great
barrow
of
Ilos,
halted
the
mules
and
horses
at
the
river
to
drink;
for
darkness
was
come
down
over
the
earth.
Then
the
herald
beheld
Hermes
from
hard
by,
and
marked
him,
and
spake
and
said
to
Priam
:
"
Consider,
son
of
Dardanos
;
this
is
matter
of
prudent
thought.
I
see
a
man,
methinks
we
shall
full
soon
be
rent
in
pieces.
Come,
let
us
flee
in
our
chariot,
or
else
at
least
touch
his
knees
and
entreat
him
that
he
have
mercy
on
us."
Thus
spake
he,
and
the
old
man
was
confounded,
and
he
was
dismayed
exceedingly,
and
the
hair
on
his
pliant
limbs
stood
up,
and
he
stood
still
amazed.
But
the
Helper
came
nigh
of
himself
and
took
the
old
man's
hand,
and
spake
and
questioned
him
:
"
Whither,
father,
dost
thou
thus
guide
these
horses
and
mules
through
the
divine
night,
when
other
mortals
are
asleep
?
Hadst
thou
no
fear
of
the
fierce-
breathing
Achaians,
thy
bitter
foes
that
are
hard
anigh
thee
?
If
one
of
them
should
espy
thee
carrying
such
treasures
through
the
swift
black
night,
what
then
would
be
thy
thought
?
Neither
art
thou
young
thyself,
and
thy
com-
panion
here
is
old,
that
ye
should
make
defence
against
a
man
that
should
assail
thee
first.
But
I
will
no
wise
harm
thee,
yea
I
will
keep
any
other
from
thy
hurt
:
for
the
similitude
of
my
dear
father
I
see
in
thee."
And
to
him
in
answer
spake
the
old
man,
godlike
Priam
:
"Even
so,
kind
son,
are
all
these
things
as
thou
sayest.
Never-
theless
hath
some
god
stretched
forth
his
hand
even
over
me
in

And
to
him
again
spake
the
Messenger,
the
slayer
of
Argus
:
"
All
this,
old
sire,
hast
thou
verily
spoken
aright.
But
come
say
this
and
tell
me
truly
whether
thou
art
taking
forth
a
great
and
goodly
treasure
unto
alien
men,
where
it
may
abide
for
thee
in
safety,
or
whether
by
this
ye
are
all
forsaking
holy
Ilios
in
fear
;
so
far
the
best
man
among
you
hath
perished,
even
thy
son
;
for
of
battle
with
the
Achaians
abated
he
never
a
jot"
And
to
him
in
answer
spake
the
old
man,
godlike
Priam
:
"
Who
art
thou,
noble
sir,
and
of
whom
art
born
?
For
meetly
hast
thou
spoken
of
the
fate
of
my
hapless
son."
And
to
him
again
spake
the
Messenger,
the
slayer
of
Argus:
"Thou
art
proving
me,
old
sire,
in
asking
me
of
noble
Hector.
Him
have
I
full
oft
seen
with
mine
eyes
in
glorious
battle,
and
when
at
the
ships
he
was
slaying
the
Argives
he
drave
thither,
piercing
them
with
the
keen
bronze,
and
we
stood
still
and
marvelled
thereat,
for
Achilles
suffered
us
not
to
fight,
being
wroth
against
Atreus'
son.
His
squire
am
I,
and
came
in
the
same
well-wrought
ship.
From
the
Myrmidons
I
come,
and
my
father
is
Polyktor.
Wealthy
is
he,
and
an
old
man
even
as
thou,
and
six
other
sons
hath
he,
and
I
am
his
seventh.
With
the
others
I
cast
lots,
and
it
fell
to
me
to
fare
hither
with
the
host.
And
now
am
I
come
from
the
ships
to
the
plain,
for
at
day-break
the
glancing-eyed
Achaians
will
set
the
battle
in
array
around
the
town.
For
it
chafeth
them
to
be
sitting
here,
nor
can
the
Achaian
lords
hold
in
their
fury
for
the
fray."
And
the
old
man,
godlike
Priam,
answered
him,
saying
:
"
If
verily
thou
art
a
squire
of
Achilles
Peleus'
son,
come
tell
me
all
the
truth,
whether
still
my
son
is
by
the
ships,
or
whether
ere
now
Achilles
hath
riven
him
limb
from
limb
and
cast
him
to
the
dogs."
Then
to
him
again
spake
the
Messenger
the
slayer
of
Argus
:
"
Old
sire,
not
yet
have
dogs
or
birds
devoured
him,
but

lieth
he
still
by
Achilles'
ship,
even
as
he
fell,
among
the
huts,
and
the
twelfth
morn
now
hath
risen
upon
him,
nor
doth
his
flesh
corrupt
at
all,
neither
worms
consume
it,
such
as
devour
men
slain
in
war.
Truly
Achilles
draggeth
him
recklessly
around
the
barrow
of
his
dear
comrade
so
oft
as
divine
day
dawneth,
yet
marreth
he
him
not
;
thou
wouldst
marvel
if
thou
couldst
go
see
thyself
how
dewy
fresh
he
lieth,
and
is
washed
clean
of
blood,
nor
anywhere
defiled
;
and
all
his
wounds
wherewith
he
was
stricken
are
closed;
howbeit
many
plunged
their
points
in
him.
So
careful
are
the
blessed
gods
of
thy
son,
though
he
be
but
a
dead
corpse,
for
they
held
him
dear
at
heart."
Thus
spake
he,
and
the
old
man
rejoiced,
and
answered
him,
saying
:
"
My
son,
it
is
verily
a
good
thing
to
give
due
offerings
withal
to
the
Immortals,
for
never
did
my
child
—
if
that
child
indeed
I
had
—
forget
in
our
halls
the
gods
who
inhabit
Olympus.
Therefore
have
they
remembered
this
for
him,
albeit
his
portion
is
death.
But
come
now
take
from
me
this
goodly
goblet,
and
guard
me
myself
and
guide
me,
under
Heaven,
that
I
may
come
unto
the
hut
of
Peleus'
son."
Then
spake
unto
him
again
the
Messenger
the
slayer
of
Argus
:
"
Thou
art
proving
me,
old
sire,
who
am
younger
than
thou,
but
thou
wilt
not
prevail
upon
me,
in
that
thou
biddest
me
take
gifts
from
thee
without
Achilles'
privity.
I
were
afraid
and
shamed
at
heart
to
defraud
him,
lest
some
evil
come
to
pass
on
me
hereafter.
But
as
thy
guide
I
would
go
even
unto
famous
Argos,
accompanying
thee
courteously
in
swift
ship
or
on
foot.
Not
from
scorn
of
thy
guide
would
any
assail
thee
then."
Thus
spake
the
Helper,
and
leaping
on
the
chariot
behind
the
horses
he
swiftly
took
lash
and
reins
into
his
hand,
and
breathed
brave
spirit
into
horses
and
mules.
But
when
they
were
come
to
the
towers
and
trench
of
the
ships,
there
were
492
ILIAD

the
sentinels
just
busying
them
about
their
supper.
Then
the
Messenger,
the
slayer
of
Argus,
shed
sleep
upon
them
all,
and
straightway
opened
the
gates
and
thrust
back
the
bars,
and
brought
within
Priam
and
the
splendid
gifts
upon
his
wain.
And
they
came
to
the
lofty
hut
of
the
son
of
Peleus,
which
the
Myrmidons
made
for
their
king
and
hewed
therefor
timber
of
the
pine,
and
thatched
it
with
downy
thatching
-
rush
that
they
mowed
in
the
meadows,
and
around
it
made
for
him
their
lord
a
great
court
with
close-set
palisades
;
and
the
door
was
barred
by
a
single
bolt
of
pine
that
three
Achaians
wont
to
drive
home,
and
three
drew
back
that
mighty
bar
—
three
of
the
rest,
but
Achilles
by
himself
would
drive
it
home.
Then
opened
the
Helper
Hermes
the
door
for
the
old
man,
and
brought
in
the
splendid
gifts
for
Peleus'
fleet-footed
son,
and
descended
from
the
chariot
to
the
earth
and
spake
aloud
:
"
Old
sire,
I
that
have
come
to
thee
am
an
immortal
god,
even
HermeSj
for
my
father
sent
me
to
companion
thee
on
thy
way.
But
now
will
I
depart
from
thee
nor
come
within
Achilles'
sight
;
it
were
cause
of
wrath
that
an
immortal
god
should
thus
show
favour
openly
unto
mortals.
But
thou
go
in
and
clasp
the
knees
of
Peleus'
son
and
entreat
him
for
his
father's
sake
and
his
mother's
of
the
lovely
hair
and
for
his
child's
sake
that
thou
mayest
move
his
soul."
Thus
Hermes
spake,
and
departed
unto
high
Olympus,
But
Priam
leapt
from
the
car
to
the
earth,
and
left
Idaios
in
his
place
;
he
stayed
to
mind
the
horses
and
mules
;
but
the
old
man
made
straight
for
the
house
where
Achilles
dear
to
Zeus
was
wont
to
sit.
And
therein
he
found
the
man
him-
self,
and
his
comrades
sate
apart
:
two
only,
the
hero
Auto-
medon
and
Alkimos,
of
the
stock
of
Ares,
were
busy
in
at-
tendance
;
and
he
was
lately
ceased
from
meat,
even
from
eat-
ing
and
drinking
:
and
still
the
table
stood
beside
him.

they
were
unaware
of
great
Priam
as
he
came
in,
and
so
stood
he
anigh
and
clasped
in
his
hands
the
knees
of
Achilles,
and
kissed
his
hands,
terrible,
man-slaying,
that
slew
many
of
Pri-
am's
sons.
And
as
when
a
grievous
curse
cometh
upon
a
man
who
in
his
own
country
hath
slain
another
and
escapeth
to
a
land
of
strangers,
to
the
house
of
some
rich
man,
and
wonder
possesseth
them
that
look
on
him
—
so
Achilles
wondered
when
he
saw
godlike
Priam,
and
the
rest
wondered
likewise,
and
looked
upon
one
another.
Then
Priam
spake
and
entreated
him,
saying
:
"
Bethink
thee,
O
Achilles
like
to
gods,
of
thy
father
that
is
of
like
years
with
me,
on
the
grievous
pathway
of
old
age.
Him
haply
are
the
dwellers
round
about
entreat-
ing
evilly,
nor
is
there
any
to
ward
from
him
ruin
and
bane.
Nevertheless
while
he
heareth
of
thee
as
yet
alive
he
re-
joiceth
in
his
heart,
and
hopeth
withal
day
after
day
that
he
shall
see
his
dear
son
returning
from
Troy-land.
But
I,
I
am
utterly
unblest,
since
I
begat
sons
the
best
men
in
wide
Troy-land,
but
declare
unto
thee
that
none
of
them
is
left.
Fifty
I
had,
when
the
sons
of
the
Achaians
came
;
nineteen
were
born
to
me
oi
one
mother,
and
concubines
bare
the
rest
within
my
halls.
Now
of
the
more
part
had
impetuous
Ares
unstrung
the
knees,
and
he
who
was
yet
left
and
guarded
city
and
men,
him
slewest
thou
but
now
as
he
fought
for
his
country,
even
Hector.
For
his
sake
come
I
unto
the
ships
of
the
Achaians
that
I
may
win
him
back
from
thee,
and
I
bring
with
me
untold
ransom.
Yea,
fear
thou
the
gods,
Achilles,
and
have
compassion
on
me,
even
me,
bethinking
thee
of
thy
father.
Lo,
I
am
yet
more
piteous
than
he,
and
have
braved
what
none
other
man
on
earth
hath
braved
before,
to
stretch
forth
my
hand
toward
the
face
of
the
slayer
of
my
sons."
Thus
spake
he,
and
stirred
within
Achilles
desire
to
make
lament
for
his
father.
And
he
touched
the
old
man's
hand

and
gently
moved
him
back.
And
as
they
both
bethought
them
of
their
dead,
so
Priam
for
man-slaying
Hector
wept
sore
as
he
was
fallen
before
Achilles'
feet,
and
Achilles
wept
for
his
own
father,
and
now
again
for
Patroklos,
and
their
moan
went
up
throughout
the
house.
But
when
noble
Achilles
had
satisfied
him
with
lament,
and
the
desire
thereof
departed
from
his
heart
and
limbs,
straightway
he
sprang
from
his
seat
and
raised
the
old
man
by
his
hand,
pitying
his
hoary
head
and
hoary
beard,
and
spake
unto
him
winged
words
and
said
:
"
Ah
hapless
!
many
ill
things
verily
thou
hast
endured
in
thy
heart.
How
durst
thou
come
alone
to
the
ships
of
the
Achaians
and
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
hath
slain
full
many
of
thy
brave
sons
?
of
iron
verily
is
thy
heart.
But
come
then
set
thee
on
a
seat,
and
we
will
let
our
sorrows
lie
quiet
in
our
hearts,
for
all
our
pain,
for
no
avail
cometh
of
chill
lament.
This
is
the
lot
the
gods
have
spun
for
miserable
men,
that
they
should
live
in
pain
;
yet
themselves
are
sorrowless.
For
two
urns
stand
upon
the
floor
of
Zeus
filled
with
his
evil
gifts,
and
one
with
blessings.
To
whomsoever
Zeus
whose
joy
is
in
the
lightning
dealeth
a
mingled
lot,
that
man
chanceth
now
upon
ill
and
now
again
on
good,
but
to
whom
he
giveth
but
of
the
bad
kind
him
he
bringeth
to
scorn,
and
evil
famine
chaseth
him
over
the
goodly
earth,
and
he
is
a
wanderer
honoured
of
neither
gods
nor
men.
Even
thus
to
Peleus
gave
the
gods
splendid
gifts
from
his
birth,
for
he
excelled
all
men
in
good
fortune
and
wealth,
and
was
king
of
the
Myrmidons,
and
mortal
though
he
was
the
gods
gave
him
a
goddess
to
be
his
bride.
Yet
even
on
him
God
brought
evil,
seeing
that
there
arose
to
him
no
offspring
of
princely
sons
in
his
halls,
save
that
he
begat
one
son
to
an
untimely
death.
Neither
may
I
tend
him
as
he
groweth
old,
since

far
from
my
country
I
am
dwelling
in
Troy-land,
to
vex
thee
and

And
of
thee,
old
sire,
we
have
heard
how
of
old
time
thou
wert
happy,
even
how
of
all
that
Lesbcs,
seat
of
Makar,
boundeth
to
the
north
thereof
and
Phrygia
farther
up
and
the
vast
Hellespont
—
of
all
these
folk,
men
say,
thou
wert
the
richest
in
wealth
and
in
sons,
but
after
that
the
Powers
of
Heaven
brought
this
bane
on
thee,
ever
are
battles
and
man-
slayings
around
thy
city.
Keep
courage,
and
lament
not
unabatingly
in
thy
heart.
For
nothing
wilt
thou
avail
by
grieving
for
thy
son,
neither
shalt
thou
bring
him
back
to
life
or
ever
some
new
evil
come
upon
thee."
Then
made
answer
unto
him
the
old
man,
godlike
Priam
:
"
Bid
me
not
to
a
seat,
O
fosterling
of
Zeus,
so
long
as
Hector
lieth
uncared
for
at
the
huts,
but
straightway
give
him
back
that
I
may
behold
him
with
mine
eyes
;
and
accept
thou
the
great
ransom
that
we
bring.
So
mayest
thou
have
pleasure
thereof,
and
come
unto
thy
native
land,
since
thou
hast
spared
me
from
the
first."1
Then
fleet-footed
Achilles
looked
sternly
upon
him
and
said
:
"
No
longer
chafe
me,
old
sire
;
of
myself
am
I
minded
to
give
Hector
back
to
thee,
for
there
came
to
me
a
mes-
senger
from
Zeus,
even
my
mother
who
bare
me,
daughter
of
the
Ancient
One
of
the
Sea.
And
I
know,
O
Priam,
in
my
mind,
nor
am
unaware
that
some
god
it
is
that
hath
guided
thee
to
the
swift
ships
of
the
Achaians.
For
no
mortal
man,
even
though
in
prime
of
youth,
would
dare
to
come
among
the
host,
for
neither
could
he
escape
the
watch,
nor
easily
thrust
back
the
bolt
of
our
doors.
Therefore
now
stir
my
heart
no
more
amid
my
troubles,
lest
I
leave
not
even
thee
in
peace,
old
sire,
within
my
hut,
albeit
thou
art
my
suppliant,
and
lest
I
transgress
the
commandment
of
Zeus."
Thus
spake
he,
and
the
old
man
feared,
and
obeyed

word.
And
the
son
of
Peleus
leapt
like
a
lion
through
the
door
of
the
house,
not
alone,
for
with
him
went
two
squires,
the
hero
Automedon
and
Alkimos,
they
whom
above
all
his
comrades
Achilles
honoured,
save
only
Patroklos
that
was
dead.
They
then
loosed
from
under
the
yoke
the
horses
and
mules,
and
led
in
the
old
man's
crier-herald
and
set
him
on
a
chair,
and
from
the
wain
of
goodly
felloes
they
took
the
countless
ransom
set
on
Hector's
head.
But
they
left
two
robes
and
a
well-spun
doublet,
that
Achilles
might
wrap
the
dead
therein
when
he
gave
him
to
be
carried
home.
And
he
called
forth
handmaids
and
bade
them
wash
and
anoint
him
when
they
had
borne
him
apart,
so
that
Priam
should
not
look
upon
his
son,
lest
he
should
not
refrain
the
wrath
at
his
sorrowing
heart
when
he
should
look
upon
his
son,
and
lest
Achilles'
heart
be
vexed
thereat
and
he
slay
him
and
transgress
the
commandment
of
Zeus.
So
when
the
handmaids
had
washed
the
body
and
anointed
it
with
oil,
and
had
thrown
over
it
a
fair
robe
and
a
doublet,
then
Achilles
himself
lifted
it
and
laid
it
on
a
bier,
and
his
com-
rades
with
him
lifted
it
onto
the
polished
waggon.
Then
he
groaned
aloud
and
called
on
his
dear
comrade
by
his
name
:
"
Patroklos,
be
not
vexed
with
me
if
thou
hear
even
in
the
house
of
Hades
that
I
have
given
back
noble
Hector
unto
his
dear
father,
for
not
unworthy
is
the
ransom
he
hath
given
me,
whereof
I
will
deal
to
thee
again
thy
rightful
share."
Thus
spake
noble
Achilles,
and
went
back
into
the
hut,
and
sate
him
down
on
the
cunningly-wrought
couch
whence
he
had
arisen
by
the
opposite
wall,
and
spake
a
word
to
Priam
:
"
Thy
son,
old
sire,
is
given
back
as
thou
wouldest
and
lieth
on
a
bier,
and
with
the
break
of
day
thou
shalt
see
him
thy-
self
as
thou
carriest
him.
But
now
bethink
we
us
of
supper.
For
even
faired-haired
Niobe
bethought
her
of
meat,
she
whose
twelve
children
perished
in
her
halls,
six
daughters

497
and
six
lusty
sons.
The
sons
Apollo,
in
his
anger
against
Niobe,
slew
with
arrows
from
his
silver
bow,
and
the
daughters
archer
Artemis,
for
that
Niobe
matched
herself
against
fair-
cheeked
Leto,
saying
that
the
goddess
bare
but
twain
but
herself
many
children
:
so
they
though
they
were
but
twain
destroyed
the
others
all.
Nine
days
they
lay
in
their
blood,
nor
was
there
any
to
bury
them,
for
Kronion
turned
the
folk
to
stones.
Yet
on
the
tenth
day
the
gods
of
heaven
buried
them,
and
she
then
bethought
her
of
meat,
when
she
was
wearied
out
with
weeping
tears.
And
somewhere
now
among
the
cliffs,
on
the
lonely
mountains,
even
on
Sipylos,
where
they
say
are
the
couching-places
of
nymphs
that
dance
around
Acheloos,
there
she,
albeit
a
stone,
broodeth
still
over
her
troubles
from
the
gods.
But
come
let
us
too,
noble
father,
take
thought
of
meat,
and
afterward
thou
shalt
mourn
over
thy
dear
son
as
thou
earnest
him
to
Ilios
;
and
many
tears
shall
be
his
due."
Thus
spake
fleet
Achilles,
and
sprang
up,
and
slew
a
pure
white
sheep,
and
his
comrades
skinned
and
made
it
ready
in
seemly
fashion,
and
divided
it
cunningly
and
pierced
it
with
spits,
and
roasted
it
carefully
and
drew
all
off.
And
Auto-
medon
took
bread
and
served
it
on
a
table
in
fair
baskets,
while
Achilles
dealt
out
the
flesh.
And
they
stretched
forth
their
hands
to
the
good
cheer
lying
ready
before
them.
But
when
they
had
put
off
the
desire
of
meat
and
drink,
then
Priam
son
of
Dardanos
marvelled
at
Achilles
to
see
how
great
he
was
and
how
goodly,
for
he
was
like
a
god
to
look
upon.
And
Achilles
marvelled
at
Priam
son
of
Dardanos,
beholding
his
noble
aspect
and
hearkening
to
his
words.
But
when
they
had
gazed
their
fill
upon
one
other,
then
first
spake
the
old
man,
godlike
Priam,
to
Achilles
:
"
Now
pre-
sently
give
me
whereon
to
lie,
fosterling
of
Zeus,
that
of
sweet
sleep
also
we
may

mine
eyes
closed
beneath
their
lids
since
at
thy
hands
my
son
lost
his
life,
but
I
continually
mourn
and
brood
over
countless
griefs,
grovelling
in
the
courtyard-close
amid
the
mire.
Now
at
last
have
I
tasted
bread
and
poured
bright
wine
down
my
throat,
but
till
now
I
had
tasted
nought."
He
said,
and
Achilles
bade
his
comrades
and
handmaids
to
set
a
bedstead
beneath
the
portico,
and
to
cast
thereon
fair
shining
rugs
and
spread
coverlets
above
and
thereon
to
lay
thick
mantles
to
be
a
clothing
over
all.
And
the
maids
went
forth
from
the
inner
hall
with
torches
in
their
hands,
and
quickly
spread
two
beds
in
haste.
Then
with
bitter
mean-
ing1
said
fleet-footed
Achilles
unto
Priam
;
"
Lie
thou
with-
out,
dear
sire,
lest
there
come
hither
one
of
the
counsellors
of
the
Achaians,
such
as
ever
take
counsel
with
me
by
my
side,
as
custom
is.
If
any
of
such
should
behold
thee
through
the
swift
black
night,
forthwith
he
might
haply
tell
it
to
Agamemnon
shepherd
of
the
host,
and
thus
would
there
be
delay
in
giving
back
the
dead.
But
come
say
this
to
me
and
tell
it
true,
how
many
days'
space
thou
art
fain
to
make
funeral
for
noble
Hector,
so
that
for
so
long
I
may
myself
abide
and
may
keep
back
the
host."
And
the
old
man,
godlike
Priam,
answered
him
saying
:
"
If
thou
art
verily
willing
that
I
accomplish
noble
Hector's
funeral,
by
doing
as
thou
sayest,
O
Achilles,
thou
wilt
do
me
grace.
For
thou
knowest
how
we
are
pent
within
the
city,
and
wood
from
the
mountain
is
far
to
fetch,
and
the
Trojans
are
much
in
fear.
Nine
days
will
we
make
moan
for
him
in
our
halls,
and
on
the
tenth
we
will
hold
funeral
and
the
folk
shall
feast,
and
on
the
eleventh
we
will
make
a
barrow
over
him,
and
on
the
twelfth
we
will
do
battle
if
need
be."
Then
again
spake
the
fleet
noble
Achilles
unto
him
say-
ing
:
"
All
this,
O
ancient
Priam,
shall
be
as
thou
biddest
;

499
for
I
will
hold
back
the
battle
even
so
long
a
time
as
thou
tellest
me."
Thus
speaking
he
clasped
the
old
man's
right
hand
at
the
wrist,
lest
he
should
be
anywise
afraid
at
heart.
So
they
in
the
forepart
of
the
house
laid
them
down,
Priam
and
the
herald,
with
wise
thoughts
at
their
hearts,
but
Achilles
slept
in
a
recess
of
the
firm-wrought
hut,
and
beside
him
lay
fair-
cheeked
Briseis.
Now
all
other
gods
and
warriors
lords
of
chariots
slum-
bered
all
night,
by
soft
sleep
overcome.
But
not
on
the
Helper
Hermes
did
sleep
take
hold
as
he
sought
within
his
heart
how
he
should
guide
forth
king
Priam
from
the
ships
unespied
of
the
trusty
sentinels.
And
he
stood
above
his
head
and
spake
a
word
to
him
:
"
Old
sire,
no
thought
then
hast
thou
of
any
evil,
seeing
thou
yet
sleepest
among
men
that
are
thine
enemies,
for
that
Achilles
spared
thee.
Truly
now
hast
thou
won
back
thy
dear
son,
and
at
great
price.
But
for
thy
life
will
thy
sons
thou
hast
left
behind
be
offer-
ing
threefold
ransom,
if
but
Agamemnon
Atreus'
son
be
aware
of
thee,
and
aware
be
all
the
Achaians."
Thus
spake
he,
and
the
old
man
feared,
and
roused
the
herald.
And
Hermes
yoked
the
horses
and
mules
for
them,
and
himself
drave
them
lightly
through
the
camp,
and
none
was
aware
of
them.
But
when
they
came
to
the
ford
of
the
fair-flowing
river,
[even
eddying
Xanthos,
begotten
of
immortal
Zeus,]
then
Hermes
departed
up
to
high
Olympus,
and
Morning

the

robe

And
they
with
wail
and
moan

the

city,
and
the
mules
drew
the
dead
Nor
marked
them
any
man
or
fair-girdled
woman
until
Kassandra,
peer
of
golden
Aphrodite,
having
gone
up
upon
Pergamos,
was
aware
of
her
dear
father
as
he
stood
in
the
car,
and
the
herald
that
was
crier
to
the
town.
Then

beheld
she
him
that
lay
upon
the
bier
behind
the
mules,
and
thereat
she
wailed
and
cried
aloud
throughout
all
the
town
:
"
O
men
and
women
of
Troy,
come
ye
hither
and
look
upon
Hector,
if
ever
while
he
was
alive
ye
rejoiced
when
he
came
back
from
battle,
since
great
joy
was
he
to
the
city
and
all
the
folk."
Thus
spake
she,
nor
was
man
or
woman
left
within
the
city,
for
upon
all
came
unendurable
grief.
And
near
the
gates
they
met
Priam
bringing
home
the
dead.
First
be-
wailed
him
his
dear
wife
and
lady
mother,
as
they
cast
them
on
the
fair-wheeled
wain
and
touched
his
head
;
and
around
them
stood
the
throng
and
wept.
So
all
day
long
unto
the
setting
of
the
sun
they
had
lamented
Hector
in
tears
without
the
gate,
had
not
the
old
man
spoken
from
the
car
among
the
folk
:
"
Give
me
place
for
the
mules
to
pass
through
;
hereafter
ye
shall
have
your
fill
of
wailing,
when
I
have
brought
him
unto
his
home."
Thus
spake
he,
and
they
parted
asunder
and
gave
place
to
the
wain.
And
the
others
when
they
had
brought
him
to
the
famous
house,
laid
him
on
a
fretted
bed,
and
set
beside
him
minstrels
leaders
of
the
dirge,
who
wailed
a
mournful
lay,
while
the
women
made
moan
with
them.
And
among
the
women
white-armed
Andromache
led
the
lamentation,
while
in
her
hands
she
held
the
head
of
Hector
slayer
of
men
:
"
Husband,
thou
art
gone
young
from
life,
and
leavest
me

widow
in
thy
halls.
And
the
child

yet
but
a
little
one,
child
of
ill-fated
parents,
thee
and
me
;
nor
methinks
shall
he
grow
up
to
manhood,
for
ere
then
shall
this
city
be
utterly
destroyed.
For
thou
art
verily
perished

didst
watch
over
it,
who
guardedst
it
and
keptest
safe

noble

and

shall

Thus
spake
she
wailing,

stirred
unending
moan.

their
sore
lament
:

Thus
spake
he,
and
they
yoked
oxen
and
mules
to
wains,
and
quickly
then
they
flocked
before
the
city.
So
nine
days
they
gathered
great
store
of
wood.
But
when
the
tenth
morn
rose
with
light
for
men,
then
bare
they
forth
brave
Hector,
weeping
tears,
and
on
a
lofty
pyre
they
laid
the
dead
man,
and
thereon
cast
fire.
But
when
the
daughter
of
Dawn,

Morning,
shone
forth,
then
gathered
the
folk
around

First

they

far
as

went,
and
then
his

comrades
gathered
his

lamenting,
and
big
tears
flowed
down
their
cheeks.
And
the
bones
they
took
and
laid
in
a

urn,

them
in
