<p class="letter">
Zeus awakening, biddeth Apollo revive Hector, and restore the fortunes of the
Trojans. Fire is thrown on the ship of Protesilaos.
</p>

<p>
Now when they had sped in flight across the palisade and trench, and many were
overcome at the hands of the Danaans, the rest were stayed, and abode beside
the chariots in confusion, and pale with terror, and Zeus awoke, on the peaks
of Ida, beside Hera of the golden throne. Then he leaped up, and stood, and
beheld the Trojans and Achaians, those in flight, and these driving them on
from the rear, even the Argives, and among them the prince Poseidon. And Hector
he saw lying on the plain, and around him sat his comrades, and he was gasping
with difficult breath, and his mind wandering, and was vomiting blood, for it
was not the weakest of the Achaians that had smitten him. Beholding him, the
father of men and gods had pity on him, and terribly he spoke to Hera, with
fierce look: &ldquo;O thou ill to deal with, Hera, verily it is thy crafty wile
that has made noble Hector cease from the fight, and has terrified the host.
Nay, but yet I know not whether thou mayst not be the first to reap the fruits
of thy cruel treason, and I beat thee with stripes. Dost thou not remember,
when thou wert hung from on high, and from thy feet I suspended two anvils, and
round thy hands fastened a golden bond that might not be broken? And thou didst
hang in the clear air and the clouds, and the gods were wroth in high Olympus,
but they could not come round and unloose thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, and the ox-eyed lady Hera shuddered, and spake unto him winged
words, saying: &ldquo;Let earth now be witness hereto, and wide heaven above,
and that falling water of Styx, the greatest oath and the most terrible to the
blessed gods, and thine own sacred head, and our own bridal bed, whereby never
would I forswear myself, that not by my will does earth-shaking Poseidon
trouble the Trojans and Hector, and succour them of the other part. Nay, it is
his own soul that urgeth and commandeth him, and he had pity on the Achaians,
when he beheld them hard pressed beside the ships. I would even counsel him
also to go even where thou, lord of the storm-cloud, mayst lead him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake she, and the father of gods and men smiled, and answering her he spake
winged words: &ldquo;If thou, of a truth, O ox-eyed lady Hera, wouldst
hereafter abide of one mind with me among the immortal gods, thereon would
Poseidon, howsoever much his wish be contrariwise, quickly turn his mind
otherwhere, after thy heart and mine. But if indeed thou speakest the truth and
soothly, go thou now among the tribes of the gods, and call Iris to come
hither, and Apollo, the renowned archer, that Iris may go among the host of
mail-clad Achaians and tell Poseidon the prince to cease from the war, and get
him unto his own house. But let Phoebus Apollo spur Hector on to the war, and
breathe strength into him again, and make him forget his anguish, that now
wears down his heart, and drive the Achaians back again, when he hath stirred
in them craven fear. Let them flee and fall among the many-benched ships of
Achilles son of Peleus, and he shall rouse his own comrade, Patroklos; and him
shall renowned Hector slay with the spear, in front of Ilios, after that he has
slain many other youths, and among them my son, noble Sarpedon. In wrath
therefor shall goodly Achilles slay Hector. From that hour verily will I cause
a new pursuit from the ships, that shall endure continually, even until the
Achaians take steep Ilios, through the counsels of Athene. But before that hour
neither do I cease in my wrath, nor will I suffer any other of the Immortals to
help the Danaans there, before I accomplish that desire of the son of Peleus,
as I promised him at the first, and confirmed the same with a nod of my head,
on that day when the goddess Thetis clasped my knees, imploring me to honour
Achilles, the sacker of cities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, nor did the white-armed goddess Hera disobey him, and she sped
down from the hills of Ida to high Olympus, and went among the gathering of the
immortal gods. And she called Apollo without the hall and Iris, that is the
messenger of the immortal gods, and she spake winged words, and addressed them,
saying: &ldquo;Zeus bids you go to Ida as swiftly as may be, and when ye have
gone, and looked on the face of Zeus, do ye whatsoever he shall order and
command.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And these twain came before the face of Zeus the cloud gatherer, and stood
there, and he was nowise displeased at heart when he beheld them, for that
speedily they had obeyed the words of his dear wife. And to Iris first he spake
winged words: &ldquo;Go, get thee, swift Iris, to the prince Poseidon, and tell
him all these things, nor be a false messenger. Command him to cease from war
and battle, and to go among the tribes of the gods, or into the bright sea. But
if he will not obey my words, but will hold me in no regard, then let him
consider in his heart and mind, lest he dare not for all his strength to abide
me when I come against him, since I deem me to be far mightier than he, and
elder born.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, nor did the wind-footed fleet Iris disobey him, but went down the
hills of Ida to sacred Ilios. And as when snow or chill hail fleets from the
clouds beneath the stress of the North Wind born in the clear air, so fleetly
she fled in her eagerness, swift Iris, and drew near the renowned Earth-shaker
and spake to him the message of Zeus. And he left the host of the Achaians, and
passed to the sea, and sank, and sorely they missed him, the heroes of the
Achaians.
</p>

<p>
Then Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, spake to Apollo, saying: &ldquo;Go now,
dear Phoebus, to Hector of the helm of bronze. Let glorious Hector be thy care,
and rouse in him great wrath even till the Achaians come in their flight to the
ships, and the Hellespont. And from that moment will I devise word and deed
wherewithal the Achaians may take breath again from their toil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, nor was Apollo deaf to the word of the Father, but he went down
the hills of Ida like a fleet falcon, the bane of doves, that is the swiftest
of flying things. And he found the son of wise-hearted Priam, noble Hector,
sitting up, no longer lying, for he had but late got back his life, and knew
the comrades around him, and his gasping and his sweat had ceased, from the
moment when the will of aegis-bearing Zeus began to revive him. Then
far-darting Apollo stood near him, and spake to him: &ldquo;Hector, son of
Priam, why dost thou sit fainting apart from the others? Is it perchance that
some trouble cometh upon thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then, with faint breath answered him Hector of the glancing helm: &ldquo;Nay,
but who art thou, best of the gods, who enquirest of me face to face? Dost thou
not know that by the hindmost row of the ships of the Achaians, Aias of the
loud war-cry smote me on the breast with a stone, as I was slaying his
comrades, and made me cease from mine impetuous might? And verily I deemed that
this very day I should pass to the dead, and the house of Hades, when I had
gasped my life away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then prince Apollo the Far-darter answered him again: &ldquo;Take courage now,
so great an ally hath the son of Kronos sent thee out of Ida, to stand by thee
and defend thee, even Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, me who of old defend
thee, thyself and the steep citadel. But come now, bid thy many charioteers
drive their swift steeds against the hollow ships, and I will go before and
make smooth all the way for the chariots, and will put to flight the Achaian
heroes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and breathed great might into the shepherd of the host, and even
as when a stalled horse, full fed at the manger, breaks his tether and speedeth
at the gallop over the plain exultingly, being wont to bathe in the
fair-flowing stream, and holds his head on high, and the mane floweth about his
shoulders, and he trusteth in his glory, and nimbly his knees bear him to the
haunts and pasture of the mares, even so Hector lightly moved his feet and
knees, urging on his horsemen, when he heard the voice of the god. But as when
hounds and country folk pursue a horned stag, or a wild goat, that steep rock
and shady wood save from them, nor is it their lot to find him, but at their
clamour a bearded lion hath shown himself on the way, and lightly turned them
all despite their eagerness, even so the Danaans for a while followed on always
in their companies, smiting with swords and double-pointed spears, but when
they saw Hector going up and down the ranks of men, then were they afraid, and
the hearts of all fell to their feet.
</p>

<p>
Then to them spake Thoas, son of Andraimon, far the best of the Aitolians,
skilled in throwing the dart, and good in close fight, and in council did few
of the Achaians surpass him, when the young men were striving in debate; he
made harangue and spake among them: &ldquo;Alas, and verily a great marvel is
this I behold with mine eyes, how he hath again arisen, and hath avoided the
Fates, even Hector. Surely each of us hoped in his heart, that he had died
beneath the hand of Aias, son of Telamon. But some one of the gods again hath
delivered and saved Hector, who verily hath loosened the knees of many of the
Danaans, as methinks will befall even now, for not without the will of
loud-thundering Zeus doth he rise in the front ranks, thus eager for battle.
But come, as I declare let us all obey. Let us bid the throng turn back to the
ships, but let us as many as avow us to be the best in the host, take our
stand, if perchance first we may meet him, and hold him off with outstretched
spears, and he, methinks, for all his eagerness, will fear at heart to enter
into the press of the Danaans.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, and they heard him eagerly, and obeyed him. They that were with
Aias and the prince Idomeneus, and Teukros, and Neriones, and Meges the peer of
Ares, called to all the best of the warriors and sustained the fight with
Hector and the Trojans, but behind them the multitude returned to the ships of
the Achaians.
</p>

<p>
Now the Trojans drave forward in close ranks, and with long strides Hector led
them, while in front of him went Phoebus Apollo, his shoulders wrapped in
cloud, and still he held the fell aegis, dread, circled with a shaggy fringe,
and gleaming, that Hephaistos the smith gave to Zeus, to bear for the terror of
men; with this in his hands did he lead the host.
</p>

<p>
Now the Argives abode them in close ranks, and shrill the cry arose on both
sides, and the arrows leaped from the bow-strings, and many spears from
stalwart hands, whereof some stood fast in the flesh of young men swift in
fight, but many halfway, ere ever they reached the white flesh, stuck in the
ground, longing to glut themselves with flesh. Now so long as Phoebus Apollo
held the aegis unmoved in his hands, so long the darts smote either side amain,
and the folk fell. But when he looked face to face on the Danaans of the swift
steeds, and shook the aegis, and himself shouted mightily, he quelled their
heart in their breast, and they forgot their impetuous valour. And as when two
wild beasts drive in confusion a herd of kine, or a great flock of sheep, in
the dark hour of black night, coming swiftly on them when the herdsman is not
by, even so were the Achaians terror-stricken and strengthless, for Apollo sent
a panic among them, but still gave renown to the Trojans and Hector.
</p>

<p>
And Hector smote his horses on the shoulder with the lash, and called aloud on
the Trojans along the ranks. And they all cried out, and level with his held
the steeds that drew their chariots, with a marvellous din, and in front of
them Phoebus Apollo lightly dashed down with his feet the banks of the deep
ditch, and cast them into the midst thereof, making a bridgeway long and wide
as is a spear-cast, when a man throws to make trial of his strength. Thereby
the Trojans poured forward in their battalions, while in their van Apollo held
the splendid aegis. And most easily did he cast down the wall of the Achaians,
as when a boy scatters the sand beside the sea, first making sand buildings for
sport in his childishness, and then again, in his sport, confounding them with
his feet and hands; even so didst thou, archer Apollo, confound the long toil
and labour of the Argives, and among them rouse a panic fear.
</p>

<p>
So they were halting, and abiding by the ships, calling each to other; and
lifting their hands to all the gods did each man pray vehemently, and chiefly
prayed Nestor, the Warden of the Achaians, stretching his hand towards the
starry heaven: &ldquo;O father Zeus, if ever any one of us in wheat-bearing
Argos did burn to thee fat thighs of bull or sheep, and prayed that he might
return, and thou didst promise and assent thereto, of these things be thou
mindful, and avert, Olympian, the pitiless day, nor suffer the Trojans thus to
overcome the Achaians.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he in his prayer, and Zeus, the Lord of counsel, thundered loudly,
hearing the prayers of the ancient son of Neleus.
</p>

<p>
But the Trojans when they heard the thunder of aegis-bearing Zeus, rushed yet
the more eagerly upon the Argives, and were mindful of the joy of battle. And
as when a great wave of the wide sea sweeps over the bulwarks of a ship, the
might of the wind constraining it, which chiefly swells the waves, even so did
the Trojans with a great cry bound over the wall, and drave their horses on,
and at the hindmost row of the ships were fighting hand to hand with
double-pointed spears, the Trojans from the chariots, but the Achaians climbing
up aloft, from the black ships with long pikes that they had lying in the ships
for battle at sea, jointed pikes shod at the head with bronze.
</p>

<p>
Now the Trojans, like ravening lions, rushed upon the ships, fulfilling the
behests of Zeus, that ever was rousing their great wrath, but softened the
temper of the Argives, and took away their glory, while he spurred on the
others. For the heart of Zeus was set on giving glory to Hector, the son of
Priam, that withal he might cast fierce-blazing fire, unwearied, upon the
beaked ships, and so fulfil all the presumptuous prayer of Thetis; wherefore
wise-counselling Zeus awaited, till his eyes should see the glare of a burning
ship. For even from that hour was he to ordain the backward chase of the
Trojans from the ships, and to give glory to the Danaans. With this design was
he rousing Hector, Priam&rsquo;s son, that himself was right eager, against the
hollow ships. For short of life was he to be, yea, and already Pallas Athene
was urging against him the day of destiny, at the hand of the son of Peleus.
And fain he was to break the ranks of men, trying them wheresoever he saw the
thickest press, and the goodliest harness. Yet not even so might he break them
for all his eagerness. Nay, they stood firm, and embattled like a steep rock
and a great, hard by the hoary sea, a rock that abides the swift paths of the
shrill winds, and the swelling waves that roar against it. Even so the Danaans
steadfastly abode the Trojans and fled not away. But Hector shining with fire
on all sides leaped on the throng, and fell upon them, as when beneath the
storm-clouds a fleet wave reared of the winds falls on a swift ship, and she is
all hidden with foam, and the dread blast of the wind roars against the sail,
and the sailors fear, and tremble in their hearts, for by but a little way are
they borne forth from death, even so the spirit was torn in the breasts of the
Achaians.
</p>

<p>
So again keen battle was set by the ships. Thou wouldst deem that unwearied and
unworn they met each other in war, so eagerly they fought. And in their
striving they were minded thus; the Achaians verily deemed that never would
they flee from the danger, but perish there, but the heart of each Trojan hoped
in his breast, that they should fire the ships, and slay the heroes of the
Achaians. With these imaginations they stood to each other, and Hector seized
the stern of a seafaring ship, a fair ship, swift on the brine, that had borne
Protesilaos to Troia, but brought him not back again to his own country. Now
round his ship the Achaians and Trojans warred on each other hand to hand, nor
far apart did they endure the flights of arrows, nor of darts, but standing
hard each by other, with one heart, with sharp axes and hatchets they fought,
and with great swords, and double-pointed spears. And many fair brands,
dark-scabbarded and hilted, fell to the ground, some from the hands, some from
off the shoulders of warring men, and the black earth ran with blood. But
Hector, after that once he had seized the ship&rsquo;s stern, left not his
hold, keeping the ensign in his hands, and he called to the Trojans:
&ldquo;Bring fire, and all with one voice do ye raise the war-cry; now hath
Zeus given us the dearest day of all,—to take the ships that came hither
against the will of the gods, and brought many woes upon us, by the cowardice
of the elders, who withheld me when I was eager to fight at the sterns of the
ships, and kept back the host. But if even then far-seeing Zeus did harm our
wits, now he himself doth urge and command us onwards.&rdquo; So spake he, and
they set yet the fiercer on the Argives. And Aias no longer abode their onset,
for he was driven back by the darts, but he withdrew a little,—thinking that
now he should die,—on to the oarsmal&rsquo;s bench of seven feet long, and he
left the decks of the trim ship. There then he stood on the watch, and with his
spear he ever drave the Trojans from the ships, whosoever brought unwearied
fire, and ever he shouted terribly, calling to the Danaans: &ldquo;O friends,
Danaan heroes, men of Ares&rsquo; company, play the man, my friends, and be
mindful of impetuous valour. Do we deem that there be allies at our backs, or
some wall stronger than this to ward off death from men? Verily there is not
hard by any city arrayed with towers, whereby we might defend ourselves, having
a host that could turn the balance of battle. Nay, but we are set down in the
plain of the mailed men of Troy, with our backs against the sea, and far off
from our own land. Therefore is safety in battle, and not in slackening from
the fight.&rdquo; So spake he, and rushed on ravening for battle, with his keen
spear. And whosoever of the Trojans was coming against the ship with blazing
fire, to pleasure Hector at his urging, him would Aias wound, awaiting him with
his long spear, and twelve men in front of the ships at close quarters did he
wound.
