<p class="letter">
How Achilles fought with Hector, and slew him, and brought his body to the
ships.
</p>

<p>
Thus they throughout the city, scared like fawns, were cooling their sweat and
drinking and slaking their thirst, leaning on the fair battlements, while the
Achaians drew near the wall, setting shields to shoulders. But Hector deadly
fate bound to abide in his place, in front of Ilios and the Skaian gates. Then
to the son of Peleus spake Phoebus Apollo: &ldquo;Wherefore, son of Peleus,
pursuest thou me with swift feet, thyself being mortal and I a deathless god?
Thou hast not even yet known me, that I am a god, but strivest vehemently.
Truly thou regardest not thy task among the affliction of the Trojans whom thou
affrightedst, who now are gathered into the city, while thou heat wandered
hither. Me thou wilt never slay, for I am not subject unto death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then mightily moved spake unto him Achilles fleet of foot: &ldquo;Thou hast
baulked me, Far-darter, most mischievous of all the gods, in that thou hast
turned me hither from the wall: else should full many yet have bitten the dust
or ever within Ilios had they come. Now hast thou robbed me of great renown,
and lightly hast saved them, because thou hadst no vengeance to fear
thereafter. Verily I would avenge me on thee, had I but the power.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying toward the city he was gone in pride of heart, rushing like some
victorious horse in a chariot, that runneth lightly at full speed over the
plain; so swiftly plied Achilles his feet and knees. Him the old man Priam
first beheld as he sped across the plain, blazing as the star that cometh forth
at harvest-time, and plain seen his rays shine forth amid the host of stars in
the darkness of night, the star whose name men call Oriol&rsquo;s Dog.
Brightest of all is he, yet for an evil sign is he set, and bringeth much fever
upon hapless men. Even so on Achilles&rsquo; breast the bronze gleamed as he
ran. And the old man cried aloud and beat upon his head with his hands, raising
them on high, and with a cry called aloud beseeching his dear son; for he
before the gates was standing, all hot for battle with Achilles. And the old
man spake piteously unto him, stretching forth his hands: &ldquo;Hector,
beloved son, I pray thee await not this man alone with none beside thee, lest
thou quickly meet thy doom, slain by the son of Peleus, since he is mightier
far, a merciless man. Would the gods loved him even as do I! then quickly would
dogs and vultures devour him on the field—thereby would cruel pain go from my
heart—the man who hath bereft me of many valiant sons, slaying them and selling
them captive into far-off isles. Ay even now twain of my children, Lykaon and
Polydoros, I cannot see among the Trojans that throng into the fastness, sons
whom Laothoe bare me, a princess among women. If they be yet alive amid the
enemy&rsquo;s host, then will we ransom them with bronze and gold, for there is
store within, for much goods gave the old man famous Altes to his child. If
they be dead, then even in the house of Hades shall they be a sorrow to my soul
and to their mother, even to us who gave them birth, but to the rest of the
folk a briefer sorrow, if but thou die not by Achilles&rsquo; hand. Nay, come
within the wall, my child, that thou preserve the men and women of Troy,
neither give great triumph to the son of Peleus, and be thyself bereft of sweet
life. Have compassion also on me, the helpless one, who still can feel,
ill-fated; whom the father, Kronos&rsquo; son, will bring to naught by a
grievous doom in the path of old age, having seen full many ills, his sons
perishing and his daughters carried away captive, and his chambers laid waste
and infant children hurled to the ground in terrible war, and his sons&rsquo;
wives dragged away by the ruinous hands of the Achaians. Myself then last of
all at the street door will ravening dogs tear, when some one by stroke or
throw of the sharp bronze hath bereft my limbs of life—even the dogs I reared
in my halls about my table and to guard my door, which then having drunk my
blood, maddened at heart shall lie in the gateway. A young man all beseemeth,
even to be slain in war, to be torn by the sharp bronze and lie on the field;
though he be dead yet is all honourable to him, whate&rsquo;er be seen: but
when dogs defile the hoary head and hoary beard of an old man slain, this is
the most piteous thing that cometh upon hapless men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake the old man, and grasped his hoary hairs, plucking them from his
head, but he persuaded not Hector&rsquo;s soul. Then his mother in her turn
wailed tearfully, loosening the folds of her robe, while with the other hand
she showed her breast; and through her tears spake to him winged words:
&ldquo;Hector, my child, have regard unto this bosom and pity me, if ever I
gave thee consolation of my breast. Think of it, dear child, and from this side
the wall drive back the foe, nor stand in front to meet him. He is merciless;
if he slay thee it will not be on a bed that I or thy wife shall bewail thee,
my own dear child, but far away from us by the ships of the Argives will swift
dogs devour thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus they with wailing spake to their dear son, beseeching him sore, yet they
persuaded not Hector&rsquo;s soul, but he stood awaiting Achilles as he drew
nigh in giant might. As a serpent of the mountains upon his den awaiteth a man,
having fed on evil poisons, and fell wrath hath entered into him, and terribly
he glared as he coileth himself about his den, so Hector with courage
unquenchable gave not back, leaning his shining shield against a jutting tower.
Then sore troubled he spake to his great heart: &ldquo;Ay me, if I go within
the gates and walls, Polydamas will be first to bring reproach against me,
since he bade me lead the Trojans to the city during this ruinous night, when
noble Achilles arose. But I regarded him not, yet surely it had been better
far. And now that I have undone the host by my wantonness, I am ashamed before
the men of Troy and women of trailing robes, lest at any time some worse man
than I shall say: &lsquo;Hector by trusting his own might undid the
host.&rsquo; So will they speak; then to me would it be better far to face
Achilles and either slay him and go home, or myself die gloriously before the
city. Or what if I lay down my bossy shield and my stout helm, and lean my
spear against the wall, and go of myself to meet noble Achilles and promise him
that Helen, and with her all possessions that Alexandros brought in hollow
ships to Troy, the beginning of strife, we will give to the Sons of Atreus to
take away, and therewithal to divide in half with the Achaians all else that
this city holdeth: and if thereafter I obtain from the Trojans an oath of the
Elders that they will hide nothing but divide all in twain [whatever wealth the
pleasant city hold within]? But wherefore doth my heart debate thus? I might
come unto him and he would not pity or regard me at all, but presently slay me
unarmed as it were but a woman, if I put off my armour. No time is it now to
dally with him from oaktree or from rock, like youth with maiden, as youth and
maiden hold dalliance one with another. Better is it to join battle with all
speed: let us know upon which of us twain the Olympian shall bestow
renown.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus pondered he as he stood, but nigh on him came Achilles, peer of Enyalios
warrior of the waving helm, brandishing from his right shoulder the Pelian ash,
his terrible spear; and all around the bronze on him flashed like the gleam of
blazing fire or of the Sun as he ariseth. And trembling seized Hector as he was
aware of him, nor endured he to abide in his place, but left the gates behind
him and fled in fear. And the son of Peleus darted after him, trusting in his
swift feet. As a falcon upon the mountains, swiftest of winged things, swoopeth
fleetly after a trembling dove; and she before him fleeth, while he with shrill
screams hard at hand still darteth at her, for his heart urgeth him to seize
her; so Achilles in hot haste flew straight for him, and Hector fled beneath
the Trojans&rsquo; wall, and plied swift knees. They past the watch-place and
wind-waved wild fig-tree sped ever, away from under the wall, along the
waggon-track, and came to the two fair-flowing springs, where two fountains
rise that feed deep-eddying Skamandros. The one floweth with warm water, and
smoke goeth up therefrom around as it were from a blazing fire, while the other
even in summer floweth forth like cold hail or snow or ice that water formeth.
And there beside the springs are broad washing-troughs hard by, fair troughs of
stone, where wives and fair daughters of the men of Troy were wont to wash
bright raiment, in the old time of peace, before the sons of the Achaians came.
Thereby they ran, he flying, he pursuing. Valiant was the flier but far
mightier he who fleetly pursued him. For not for beast of sacrifice or for an
oxhide were they striving, such as are prizes for mel&rsquo;s speed of foot,
but for the life of horse-taming Hector was their race. And as when victorious
whole-hooved horses run rapidly round the turning-points, and some great prize
lieth in sight, be it a tripod or a woman, in honour of a man that is dead, so
thrice around Priam&rsquo;s city circled those twain with flying feet, and all
the gods were gazing on them. Then among them spake first the father of gods
and men: &ldquo;Ay me, a man beloved I see pursued around the wall. My heart is
woe for Hector, who hath burnt for me many thighs of oxen amid the crests of
many-folded Ida, and other times on the city-height; but now is goodly Achilles
pursuing him with swift feet round Priam&rsquo;s town. Come, give your counsel,
gods, and devise whether we shall save him from death or now at last slay him,
valiant though he be, by the hand of Achilles Peleus&rsquo; son.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then to him answered the bright-eyed goddess Athene: &ldquo;O Father, Lord of
the bright lightning and the dark cloud, what is this thou hast said? A man
that is a mortal, doomed long ago by fate, wouldst thou redeem back from
ill-boding death? Do it, but not all we other gods approve.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And unto her in answer spake cloud-gathering Zeus: &ldquo;Be of good cheer,
Trito-born, dear child: not in full earnest speak I, and I would fain be kind
to thee. Do as seemeth good to thy mind, and draw not back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he roused Athene, that already was set thereon, and from the crests
of Olympus she darted down.
</p>

<p>
But after Hector sped fleet Achilles chasing him vehemently. And as when on the
mountains a hound hunteth the fawn of a deer, having started it from its
covert, through glens and glades, and if it crouch to baffle him under a bush,
yet scenting it out the hound runneth constantly until he find it; so Hector
baffled not Peleus&rsquo; fleet-footed son. Oft as he set himself to dart under
the well-built walls over against the Dardanian gates, if haply from above they
might succour him with darts, so oft would Achilles gain on him and turn him
toward the plain, while himself he sped ever on the city-side. And as in a
dream one faileth in chase of a flying man, the one faileth in his flight and
the other in his chase—so failed Achilles to overtake him in the race, and
Hector to escape. And thus would Hector have avoided the visitation of death,
had not this time been utterly the last wherein Apollo came nigh to him, who
nerved his strength and his swift knees. For to the host did noble Achilles
sign with his head, and forbade them to hurl bitter darts against Hector, lest
any smiting him should gain renown, and he himself come second. But when the
fourth time they had reached the springs, then the Father hung his golden
balances, and set therein two lots of dreary death, one of Achilles, one of
horse-taming Hector, and held them by the midst and poised. Then Hector&rsquo;s
fated day sank down, and fell to the house of Hades, and Phoebus Apollo left
him. But to Peleus&rsquo; son came the bright-eyed goddess Athene, and standing
near spake to him winged words: &ldquo;Now verily, glorious Achilles dear to
Zeus, I have hope that we twain shall carry off great glory to the ships for
the Achaians, having slain Hector, for all his thirst for fight. No longer is
it possible for him to escape us, not even though far-darting Apollo should
travail sore, grovelling before the Father, aegis-bearing Zeus. But do thou now
stand and take breath, and I will go and persuade this man to confront thee in
fight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake Athene, and he obeyed, and was glad at heart, and stood leaning on
his bronze-pointed ashen-spear. And she left him and came to noble Hector, like
unto Deiphobos in shape and in strong voice, and standing near spake to him
winged words: &ldquo;Dear brother, verily fleet Achilles doth thee violence,
chasing thee round Priam&rsquo;s town with swift feet: but come let us make a
stand and await him on our defence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then answered her great Hector of the glancing helm: &ldquo;Deiphobos, verily
aforetime wert thou far dearest of my brothers, but now methinks I shall honour
thee even more, in that thou hast dared for my sake, when thou sawest me, to
come forth of the wall, while the others tarry within.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then to him again spake the bright-eyed goddess Athene: &ldquo;Dear brother, of
a truth my father and lady mother and my comrades around besought me much,
entreating me in turn, to tarry there, so greatly do they all tremble before
him; but my heart within was sore with dismal grief. And now fight we with
straight-set resolve and let there be no sparing of spears, that we may know
whether Achilles is to slay us and carry our bloody spoils to the hollow ships,
or whether he might be vanquished by thy spear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying Athene in her subtlety led him on. And when they were come nigh in
onset on one another, to Achilles first spake great Hector of the glancing
helm: &ldquo;No longer, son of Peleus, will I fly thee, as before I thrice ran
round the great town of Priam, and endured not to await thy onset. Now my heart
biddeth me stand up against thee; I will either slay or be slain. But come
hither and let us pledge us by our gods, for they shall be best witnesses and
beholders of covenants: I will entreat thee in no outrageous sort, if Zeus
grant me to outstay thee, and if I take thy life, but when I have despoiled
thee of thy glorious armour, O Achilles, I will give back thy dead body to the
Achaians, and do thou the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But unto him with grim gaze spake Achilles fleet of foot: &ldquo;Hector, talk
not to me, thou madman, of covenants. As between men and lions there is no
pledge of faith, nor wolves and sheep can be of one mind, but imagine evil
continually against each other, so is it impossible for thee and me to be
friends, neither shall be any pledge between us until one or other shall have
fallen and glutted with blood Ares, the stubborn god of war. Bethink thee of
all thy soldiership: now behoveth it thee to quit thee as a good spearman and
valiant man of war. No longer is there way of escape for thee, but Pallas
Athene will straightway subdue thee to my spear; and now in one hour shalt thou
pay back for all my sorrows for my friends whom thou hast slain in the fury of
thy spear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and poised his far-shadowing spear and hurled. And noble Hector
watched the coming thereof and avoided it; for with his eye on it he crouched,
and the bronze spear flew over him, and fixed itself in the earth; but Pallas
Athene caught it up and gave it back to Achilles, unknown of Hector shepherd of
hosts. Then Hector spake unto the noble son of Peleus: &ldquo;Thou hast missed,
so no wise yet, godlike Achilles, has thou known from Zeus the hour of my doom,
though thou thoughtest it. Cunning of tongue art thou and a deceiver in speech,
that fearing thee I might forget my valour and strength. Not as I flee shalt
thou plant thy spear in my reins, but drive it straight through my breast as I
set on thee, if God hath given thee to do it. Now in thy turn avoid my spear of
bronze. O that thou mightst take it all into thy flesh! Then would the war be
lighter to the Trojans, if but thou wert dead, for thou art their greatest
bane.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and poised his long-shadowed spear and hurled it, and smote the midst
of the shield of Peleus&rsquo; son, and missed him not: but far from the shield
the spear leapt back. And Hector was wroth that his swift weapon had left his
hand in vain, and he stood downcast, for he had no second ashen spear. And he
called with a loud shout to Deiphobos of the white shield, and asked of him a
long spear, but he was no wise nigh. Then Hector knew he truth in his heart,
and spake and said: &ldquo;Ay me, now verily the gods have summoned me to
death. I deemed the warrior Deiphobos was by my side, but he is within the
wall, and it was Athene who played me false. Now therefore is evil death come
very nigh me, not far off, nor is there way of escape. This then was from of
old the pleasure of Zeus and of the far-darting son of Zeus, who yet before
were fain to succour me: but now my fate hath found me. At least let me not die
without a struggle or ingloriously, but in some great deed of arms whereof men
yet to be born shall hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he drew his sharp sword that by his flank hung great and strong,
and gathered himself and swooped like a soaring eagle that darteth to the plain
through the dark clouds to seize a tender lamb or crouching hare. So Hector
swooped, brandishing his sharp sword. And Achilles made at him, for his heart
was filled with wild fierceness, and before his breast he made a covering with
his fair graven shield, and tossed his bright four-plated helm; and round it
waved fair golden plumes [that Hephaistos had set thick about the crest.]. As a
star goeth among stars in the darkness of night, Hesperos, fairest of all stars
set in heaven, so flashed there forth a light from the keen spear Achilles
poised in his right hand, devising mischief against noble Hector, eyeing his
fair flesh to find the fittest place. Now for the rest of him his flesh was
covered by the fair bronze armour he stripped from strong Patroklos when he
slew him, but there was an opening where the collar bones coming from the
shoulders clasp the neck, even at the gullet, where destruction of life cometh
quickliest; there, as he came on, noble Achilles drave at him with his spear,
and right through the tender neck went the point. Yet the bronze-weighted ashen
spear clave not the windpipe, so that he might yet speak words of answer to his
foe. And he fell down in the dust, and noble Achilles spake exultingly:
&ldquo;Hector, thou thoughtest, whilst thou wert spoiling Patroklos, that thou
wouldst be safe, and didst reck nothing of me who was afar, thou fool. But away
among the hollow ships his comrade, a mightier far, even I, was left behind,
who now have unstrung thy knees. Thee shall dogs and birds tear foully, but his
funeral shall the Achaians make.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then with faint breath spake unto him Hector of the glancing helm: &ldquo;I
pray thee by thy life and knees and parents leave me not for dogs of the
Achaians to devour by the ships, but take good store of bronze and gold, gifts
that my father and lady mother shall give to thee, and give them home my body
back again, that the Trojans and Trojans&rsquo; wives give me my due of fire
after my death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But unto him with grim gaze spake Achilles fleet of foot: &ldquo;Entreat me
not, dog, by knees or parents. Would that my heart&rsquo;s desire could so bid
me myself to carve and eat raw thy flesh, for the evil thou hast wrought me, as
surely is there none that shall keep the dogs from thee, not even should they
bring ten or twenty fold ransom and here weigh it out, and promise even more,
not even were Priam Dardanos&rsquo; son to bid pay thy weight in gold, not even
so shall thy lady mother lay thee on a bed to mourn her son, but dogs and birds
shall devour thee utterly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then dying spake unto him Hector of the glancing helm: &ldquo;Verily I know
thee and behold thee as thou art, nor was I destined to persuade thee; truly
thy heart is iron in thy breast. Take heed now lest I draw upon thee wrath of
gods, in the day when Paris and Phoebus Apollo slay thee, for all thy valour,
at the Skaian gate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He ended, and the shadow of death came down upon him, and his soul flew forth
of his limbs and was gone to the house of Hades, wailing her fate, leaving her
vigour and youth. Then to the dead man spake noble Achilles: &ldquo;Die: for my
death, I will accept it whensoever Zeus and the other immortal gods are minded
to accomplish it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and from the corpse drew forth his bronze spear, and set it aside, and
stripped the bloody armour from the shoulders. And other sons of Achaians ran
up around, who gazed upon the stature and marvellous goodliness of Hector. Nor
did any stand by but wounded him, and thus would many a man say looking toward
his neighbour: &ldquo;Go to, of a truth far easier to handle is Hector now than
when he burnt the ships with blazing fire.&rdquo; Thus would many a man say,
and wound him as he stood hard by. And when fleet noble Achilles had despoiled
him, he stood up among the Achaians and spake winged words: &ldquo;Friends,
chiefs and counsellors of the Argives, since the gods have vouchsafed us to
vanquish this man who hath done us more evil than all the rest together, come
let us make trial in arms round about the city, that we may know somewhat of
the Trojans&rsquo; purpose, whether since he hath fallen they will forsake the
citadel, or whether they are minded to abide, albeit Hector is no more. But
wherefore doth my heart debate thus? There lieth by the ships a dead man
unbewailed, unburied, Patroklos; him will I not forget, while I abide among the
living and my knees can stir. Nay if even in the house of Hades the dead forget
their dead, yet will I even there be mindful of my dear comrade. But come, ye
sons of the Achaians, let us now, singing our song of victory, go back to the
hollow ships and take with us our foe. Great glory have we won; we have slain
the noble Hector, unto whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city, as he had
been a god.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and devised foul entreatment of noble Hector. The tendons of both feet
behind he slit from heel to ankle-joint, and thrust therethrough thongs of
ox-hide, and bound him to his chariot, leaving his head to trail. And when he
had mounted the chariot and lifted therein the famous armour, he lashed his
horses to speed, and they nothing loth flew on. And dust rose around him that
was dragged, and his dark hair flowed loose on either side, and in the dust lay
all his once fair head, for now had Zeus given him over to his foes to entreat
foully in his own native land.
</p>

<p>
Thus was his head all grimed with dust. But his mother when she beheld her son,
tore her hair and cast far from her her shining veil, and cried aloud with an
exceeding bitter cry. And piteously moaned his father, and around them the folk
fell to crying and moaning throughout the town. Most like it seemed as though
all beetling Ilios were burning utterly in fire. Scarcely could the folk keep
back the old man in his hot desire to get him forth of the Dardanian gates. For
he besought them all, casting himself down in the mire, and calling on each man
by his name: &ldquo;Hold, friends, and though you love me leave me to get me
forth of the city alone and go unto the ships of the Achaians. Let me pray this
accursed horror-working man, if haply he may feel shame before his age-fellows
and pity an old man. He also hath a father such as I am, Peleus, who begat and
reared him to be a bane of Trojans—and most of all to me hath he brought woe.
So many sons of mine hath he slain in their flower—yet for all my sorrow for
the rest I mourn them all less than this one alone, for whom my sharp grief
will bring me down to the house of Hades—even Hector. Would that he had died in
my arms; then would we have wept and wailed our fill, his mother who bore him
to her ill hap, and I myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he wailing, and all the men of the city made moan with him. And
among the women of Troy, Hekabe led the wild lament: &ldquo;My child, ah, woe
is me! wherefore should I live in my pain, now thou art dead, who night and day
wert my boast through the city, and blessing to all, both men and women of Troy
throughout the town, who hailed thee as a god, for verily an exceeding glory to
them wert thou in thy life:—now death and fate have overtaken thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake she wailing. But Hector&rsquo;s wife knew not as yet, for no true
messenger had come to tell her how her husband abode without the gates, but in
an inner chamber of the lofty house she was weaving a double purple web, and
broidering therein manifold flowers. Then she called to her goodly-haired
handmaids through the house to set a great tripod on the fire, that Hector
might have warm washing when he came home out of the battle fond heart, and was
unaware how, far from all washings, bright-eyed Athene had slain him by the
hand of Achilles. But she heard shrieks and groans from the battlements, and
her limbs reeled, and the shuttle fell from her hands to earth. Then again
among her goodly-haired maids she spake: &ldquo;Come two of ye this way with me
that I may see what deeds are done. It was the voice of my husband&rsquo;s
noble mother that I heard, and in my own breast my heart leapeth to my mouth
and my knees are numbed beneath me: surely some evil thing is at hand against
the children of Priam. Would that such word might never reach my ear! yet
terribly I dread lest noble Achilles have cut off bold Hector from the city by
himself and chased him to the plain and ere this ended his perilous pride that
possessed him, for never would he tarry among the throng of men but ran out
before them far, yielding place to no man in his hardihood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying she sped through the chamber like one mad, with beating heart, and
with her went her handmaidens. But when she came to the battlements and the
throng of men, she stood still upon the wall and gazed, and beheld him dragged
before the city:—swift horses dragged him recklessly toward the hollow ships of
the Achaians. Then dark night came on her eyes and shrouded her, and she fell
backward and gasped forth her spirit. From off her head she shook the bright
attiring thereof, frontlet and net and woven band, and veil, the veil that
golden Aphrodite gave her on the day when Hector of the glancing helm led her
forth of the house of Eetion, having given bride-gifts untold. And around her
thronged her husband&rsquo;s sisters and his brothers&rsquo; wives, who held
her up among them, distraught even to death. But when at last she came to
herself and her soul returned into her breast, then wailing with deep sobs she
spake among the women of Troy: &ldquo;O Hector, woe is me! to one fate then
were we both born, thou in Troy in the house of Priam, and I in Thebe under
woody Plakos, in the house of Eetion, who reared me from a little one—ill-fated
sire of cruel-fated child. Ah, would he have begotten me not. Now thou to the
house of Hades beneath the secret places of the earth departest, and me in
bitter mourning thou leavest a widow in thy halls: and thy son is but an infant
child—son of unhappy parents, thee and me—nor shalt thou profit him, Hector,
since thou art dead, neither he thee. For even if he escape the Achaians&rsquo;
woful war, yet shall labour and sorrow cleave unto him hereafter, for other men
shall seize his lands. The day of orphanage sundereth a child from his fellows,
and his head is bowed down ever, and his cheeks are wet with tears. And in his
need the child seeketh his father&rsquo;s friends, plucking this one by cloak
and that by coat, and one of them that pity him holdeth his cup a little to his
mouth, and moisteneth his lips, but his palate he moisteneth not. And some
child unorphaned thrusteth him from the feast with blows and taunting words,
&lsquo;Out with thee! no father of thine is at our board.&rsquo; Then weeping
to his widowed mother shall he return, even Astyanax, who erst upon his
father&rsquo;s knee ate only marrow and fat flesh of sheep; and when sleep fell
on him and he ceased from childish play, then in bed in his nurse&rsquo;s arms
he would slumber softly nested, having satisfied his heart with good things;
but now that he hath lost his father he will suffer many ills, Astyanax—that
name the Trojans gave him, because thou only wet the defence of their gates and
their long walls. But now by the beaked ships, far from thy parents, shall
coiling worms devour thee when the dogs have had their fill, as thou liest
naked; yet in these halls lieth raiment of thine, delicate and fair, wrought by
the hands of women. But verily all these will I consume with burning fire—to
thee no profit, since thou wilt never lie therein, yet that his be honour to
thee from the men and the women of Troy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake she wailing, and the women joined their moan.
