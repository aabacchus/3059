How Achilles made havoc among the men of Troy.
</p>

<p>
So by the beaked ships around thee, son of Peleus, hungry for war, the Achaians
armed; and over against them the men of Troy, upon the high ground of the
plain.
</p>

<p>
But Zeus bade Themis call the gods to council from many-folded Olympus&rsquo;
brow; and she ranged all about and bade them to the house of Zeus. There was no
River came not up, save only Ocean, nor any nymph, of all that haunt fair
thickets and springs of rivers and grassy water-meadows. And they came to the
house of Zeus who gathereth the clouds, and sat them down in the polished
colonnades which Hephaistos in the cunning of his heart had wrought for father
Zeus.
</p>

<p>
Thus gathered they within the doors of Zeus; nor was the Earthshaker heedless
of the goddess&rsquo; call, but from the salt sea came up after the rest, and
set him in the midst, and inquired concerning the purpose of Zeus:
&ldquo;Wherefore, O Lord of the bright lightning, hast thou called the gods
again to council? Say, ponderest thou somewhat concerning the Trojans and
Achaians? for lo, the war and the fighting of them are kindled very
nigh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Zeus, who gathered the clouds, answered him, saying: &ldquo;Thou knowest, O
Earthshaker, the purpose within my breast, wherefor I gathered you hither; even
in their perishing have I regard unto them. But for me I will abide here,
sitting within a fold of Olympus, where I will gladden my heart with gazing;
but go all ye forth that ye come among the Trojans and Achaians and succour
these or those, howsoever each of you hath a mind. For if Achilles alone shall
fight against the Trojans, not even a little while shall they hold back the son
of Peleus, the fleet of foot. Nay, but even aforetime they trembled when they
looked upon him; now therefore that his wrath for his friend is waxen terrible
I fear me lest he overleap the bound of fate, and storm the wall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake the son of Kronos, and roused unabating war. For on this side and on
that the gods went forth to war: to the company of the ships went Hera, and
Pallas Athene, and Poseidon, Earth-enfolder, and the Helper Hermes, pro-eminent
in subtle thoughts; and with these went Hephaistos in the greatness of his
strength, halting, but his shrunk legs moved nimbly under him: but to the
Trojans went Ares of the glancing helm, and with him Phoebus of the unshorn
hair, and archer Artemis, and Leto and Xanthos and laughter-loving Aphrodite.
</p>

<p>
Now for so long as gods were afar from mortal men, so long waxed the Achaians
glorious, for that Achilles was come forth among them, and his long ceasing
from grim battle was at an end. And the Trojans were smitten with sore
trembling in the limbs of every one of them, in terror when they beheld the son
of Peleus, fleet of foot, blazing in his arms, peer of man-slaying Ares. But
when among the mellay of men the Olympians were come down, then leapt up in her
might Strife, rouser of hosts, then sent forth Athene a cry, now standing by
the hollowed trench without the wall, and now on the echoing shores she shouted
aloud. And a shout uttered Ares against her, terrible as the blackness of the
storm, now from the height of the city to the Trojans calling clear, or again
along Simois shore over Kallikolon he sped.
</p>

<p>
So urged the blessed gods both hosts to battle, then themselves burst into
fierce war. And terribly thundered the father of gods and men from heaven
above; and from beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake and the steep
mountain tops. Then trembled all the spurs of many-fountained Ida, and all her
crests, and the city of the Trojans, and the ships of the Achaians. And the
Lord of the Underworld, Aiedoneus, had terror in hell, and leapt from his
throne in that terror and cried aloud, lest the world be cloven above him by
Poseidon, Shaker of earth, and his dwelling-place be laid bare to mortals and
immortals—grim halls, and vast, and lothly to the gods. So loud the roar rose
of that battle of gods. For against King Poseidon stood Phoebus Apollo with his
winged arrows, and against Enyalios stood Athene, bright-eyed goddess, and
against Hera she of the golden shafts and echoing chase, even archer Artemis,
sister of the Far-darter; and against Leto the strong Helper Hermes, and
against Hephaistos the great deep-eddying River, whom gods call Xanthos and men
Skamandros.
</p>

<p>
Thus gods with gods were matched. Meanwhile Achilles yearned above all to meet
Hector, son of Priam, in the fray; for with that blood chiefliest his spirit
bade him sate Ares, stubborn lord of war. But straightway Apollo, rouser of
hosts, moved Aineias to go to meet the son of Peleus, and filled him with brave
spirit: and he made his own voice like the voice of Lykaon the son of Priam; in
his semblance spake Apollo, son of Zeus: &ldquo;Aineias, counsellor of Trojans,
where now are thy threats wherewith thou didst boast to the Trojan lords over
thy wine, saying thou wouldest stand up in battle against Achilles,
Peleus&rsquo; son?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And to him Aineias answered and said: &ldquo;Son of Priam, why biddest thou me
thus face the fierce son of Peleus in battle, though I be not fain thereto? Not
for the first time now shall I match me with Achilles, fleet of foot; once
before drave he me with his spear from Ida, when he harried our kine and wasted
Lyrnessos and Pedasos; but Zeus delivered me out of his hand and put strength
into my knees that they were swift. Else had I fallen beneath the hands of
Achilles, and of Athene who went before and gave him light, and urged him to
slay Leleges and Trojans with his spear of bronze. Therefore it is impossible
for man to face Achilles in fight, for that ever some god is at his side to
ward off death. Ay, and at any time his spear flieth straight, neither ceaseth
till it have pierced through flesh of man. But if God once give us fair field
of battle, not lightly shall he overcome me, not though he boast him made of
bronze throughout.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And to him in answer spake Apollo son of Zeus: &ldquo;Yea, hero, pray thou too
to the everliving gods; for thou too, men say, wast born of Aphrodite daughter
of Zeus, and Achilles&rsquo; mother is of less degree among the gods. For thy
mother is child of Zeus, his but of the Ancient One of the Sea. Come, bear up
thy unwearying spear against him, let him no wise turn thee back with revilings
and bitter words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and breathed high spirit into the shepherd of the host, and he went
onward through the forefront of the fighting, harnessed in flashing bronze. But
white-armed Hera failed not to discern Anchises&rsquo; son as he went through
the press of men to meet the son of Peleus, and gathering the gods about her
she spake among them thus: &ldquo;Consider ye twain, Poseidon and Athene,
within your hearts, what shall come of these things that are done. Here is
Aineias gone forth harnessed in flashing bronze, to meet the son of Peleus, and
it is Phoebus Apollo that hath sent him. Come then, be it ours to turn him back
straightway; or else let some one of us stand likewise beside Achilles and give
him mighty power, so that he fail not in his spirit, but know that they who
love him are the best of the Immortals, and that they who from of old ward war
and fighting from the Trojans are vain as wind. All we from Olympus are come
down to mingle in this fight that he take no hurt among the Trojans on this
day—afterward he shall suffer whatsoever things Fate span for him with her
thread, at his beginning, when his mother bare him. If Achilles learn not this
from voice divine, then shall he be afraid when some god shall come against him
in the battle; for gods revealed are hard to look upon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then to her made answer Poseidon, Shaker of the earth: &ldquo;Hera, be not
fierce beyond wisdom; it behoveth thee not. Not fain am I at least to match
gods with gods in strife. Let us go now into some high place apart and seat us
there to watch, and battle shall be left to men. Only if Ares or Phoebus Apollo
fall to fighting, or put constraint upon Achilles and hinder him from fight,
then straightway among us too shall go up the battle-cry of strife; right soon,
methinks, shall they hie them from the issue of the fray back to Olympus to the
company of the gods, overcome by the force of our hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake the blue-haired god, and led the way to the mounded wall of
heaven-sprung Herakles, that lofty wall built him by the Trojans and Pallas
Athene, that he might escape the monster and be safe from him, what time he
should make his onset from the beach to the plain. There sate them down
Poseidon and the other gods, and clothed their shoulders with impenetrable
cloud. And they of the other part sat down on the brows of Kallikolon around
thee, Archer Phoebus, and Ares waster of cities. Thus they on either side sat
devising counsels, but shrank all from falling to grievous war, and Zeus from
his high seat commanded them.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the whole plain was filled with men and horses and ablaze with
bronze; and the earth rang with the feet of them as they rushed together in the
fray. Two men far better than the rest were meeting in the midst between the
hosts, eager for battle, Aineias, Anchises&rsquo; son, and noble Achilles.
First came on Aineias threateningly, tossing his strong helm; his rapid shield
he held before his breast, and brandished his bronze spear. And on the other
side the son of Peleus rushed to meet him like a lion, a ravaging lion whom men
desire to slay, a whole tribe assembled: and first he goeth his way unheeding,
but when some warrior youth hath smitten him with a spear, the he gathereth
himself open-mouthed, and foam cometh forth about his teeth, and his stout
spirit groaneth in his heart, and with his tail he scourgeth either side his
ribs and flanks and goadeth himself on to fight, and glaring is borne straight
on them by his passion, to try whether he shall slay some man of them, or
whether himself shall perish in the forefront of the throng: thus was Achilles
driven of his passion and valiant spirit to go forth to meet Aineias great of
heart. And when they were come near against each other, then first to Aineias
spake fleet-footed noble Achilles: &ldquo;Aineias, wherefore hast thou so far
come forward from the crowd to stand against me: doth thy heart bid thee fight
with me in hope of holding Priam&rsquo;s honour and lordship among the
horse-taming Trojans? Nay, though thou slay me, not for that will Priam lay his
kingdom in thy hands, for he hath sons, and is sound and of unshaken mind. Or
have the Trojans allotted thee some lot of ground more choice than all the
rest, fair land of tilth and orchard, that thou mayest dwell therein, if thou
slay me? But methinks thou wilt find the slaying hard; for once before, I ween,
have I made thee flee before my spear. Host thou forgotten the day when thou
wert alone with the kine, and I made thee run swift-footed down Ida&rsquo;s
steeps in haste?—then didst thou not look behind thee in thy flight. Thence
fleddest thou to Lernessos, but I wasted it, having fought against it with the
help of Athene and of father Zeus, and carried away women captive, bereaving
them of their day of freedom: only thee Zeus shielded, and other gods. But not
this time, methinks, shall they shield thee, as thou imaginest in thy heart:
therefore I bid thee go back into the throng and come not forth against me,
while as yet thou art unhurt—after the event even a fool is wise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then to him in answer again Aineias spake: &ldquo;Son of Peleus, think not with
words to affright me as a child, since I too well know myself how to speak
taunts and unjust speech. We know each other&rsquo;s race and lineage in that
we have heard the fame proclaimed by mortal men, but never hast thou set eyes
on my parents, or I on thine. Thou, they say, art son of nobie Peleus, and of
Thetis of the fair tresses, the daughter of the sea: the sire I boast is
Anchises great of heart, and my mother is Aphrodite. Of these shall one pair or
the other mourn their dear son today; for verily not with idle words shall we
two satisfy our strife and depart out of the battle. But, if thou wilt, learn
also this, that thou mayest well know our lineage, known to full many men:
First Zeus the cloud-gatherer begat Dardanos, and he stablished Dardania, for
not yet was holy Ilios built upon the plain to be a city of mortal men, but
still they dwelt on slopes of many-fountained Ida. Then Dardanos begat a son,
king Erichthonios, who became richest of mortal men. Three thousand mares had
he that pastured along the marsh meadow, rejoicing in their tender foals. Of
them was Boreas enamoured as they grazed, and in semblance of a dark-maned
horse he covered them: then they having conceived bare twelve fillies. These
when they bounded over Earth the grain-giver would run upon the topmost ripened
ears of corn and break them not; and when they bounded over the broad backs of
the sea they would run upon the crests of the breakers of the hoary brine. Then
Erichthonios begat Tros to be load over the Trojans, and to Tros three noble
sons were born, Ilos and Assarakos and godlike Ganymedes, who became the most
beautiful of mortal men. Him the gods caught up to be cupbearer to Zeus, for
sake of his beauty, that he might dwell among immortals. Then Ilos again begat
a son, noble Laomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonos and Priam and Lamppos and
Klytios and Hiketaon, of the stock of Ares. And Assarakos begat Kapys, and
Kapys Anchises, and Anchises me; but Priam begat the goodly Hector.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lo then of this blood and lineage declare I myself unto thee. But for
valour, Zeus increaseth it in men or minisheth it according as he will, for he
is lord of all. But come, let us talk thus together no longer like children,
standing in mid onset of war. For there are revilings in plenty for both of us
to utter—a hundred-thwarted ship would not suffice for the load of them. Glib
is the tongue of man, and many words are therein of every kind, and wide is the
range of his speech hither and thither. Whatsoever word thou speak, such wilt
thou hear in answer. But what need that we should bandy strife and wrangling
each against each. Not by speech shalt thou turn me from the battle that I
desire, until we have fought together, point to point: come then, and
straightway we will each try the other with bronze-headed spears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and against that other&rsquo;s dread and mighty shield hurled his
great spear, and the shield rang loud beneath the spear-point. And the son of
Peleus held away the shield from him with his stout hand, in fear, for he
thought that the far-shadowing spear of Aineias great of heart would lightly
pierce it through—fond man, and knew not in his mind and heart that not lightly
do the glorious gifts of gods yield to force of mortal men. So did not the
great spear of wise Aineias pierce that shield, for the gold resisted it, even
the gift of the god. Yet through two folds he drave it, but three remained, for
five folds had the lame god welded, two bronze, and two inside of tin, and one
of gold; therein was stayed the ashen spear.
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles in his turn hurled his far-shadowing spear, and smote upon the
circle of the shield of Aineias, beneath the edge of the rim, where the bronze
ran thinnest round, and the bull-hide was thinnest thereon; and right through
sped the Pelian ashen spear, and the shield cracked under it. And Aineias
crouched and held up the shield away from him in dread; and the spear flew over
his back and fixed itself in the earth, having divided asunder the two circles
of the sheltering shield. And having escaped the long spear he stood still, and
a vast anguish drowned his eyes, affrighted that the spear was planted by him
so nigh. But Achilles drew his sharp sword and furiously made at him, crying
his terrible cry: then Aineias grasped in his hand a stone (a mighty deed) such
as two men, as men now are, would not avail to lift, but he with ease wielded
it all alone. Then would Aineias have smitten him with the stone as he charged,
either on helm or shield, which had warded from him bitter death, and then
would the son of Peleus have closed and slain him with his sword, had not
Poseidon, Shaker of earth, marked it with speed, and straightway spoken among
the immortal gods: &ldquo;Alas, woe is me for Aineias great of heart, who
quickly will go down to Hades slain by the son of Peleus, for that he will obey
the words of Apollo the far-darter, fond man, but nowise shall the god help him
from grievous death. But wherefore now is he to suffer ill in his innocence,
causelessly for others&rsquo; wickedness, yet welcome ever are his offerings to
the gods who inhabit the spacious heaven? Come, let us guide him out of
death&rsquo;s way, lest the son of Kronos be wroth, if Achilles slay him; for
it is appointed to him to escape, that the race of Dardanos perish not without
seed or sign, even Dardanos whom the son of Kronos loved above all the children
born to him from the daughters of men. For the race of Priam hath Zeus already
hated. But thus shall the might of Aineias reign among the Trojans, and his
childrel&rsquo;s children, who shall be born in the aftertime.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And him then answered Hera the ox-eyed queen: &ldquo;Shaker of earth, thyself
with thine own mind take counsel, whether thou wilt save Aineias, or leave him
[to be slain, brave though he be, by Achilles, Peleus&rsquo; son]. For by many
oaths among all the Immortals have we two sworn, even Pallas Athene and I,
never to help the Trojans from their evil day, not even when all Troy shall
burn in the burning of fierce fire, and they that burn her shall be the warlike
sons of the Achaians.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now when Poseidon Shaker of earth heard that, he went up amid the battle and
the clash of spears, and came where Aineias and renowned Achilles were. Then
presently he shed mist over the eyes of Achilles, Peleus&rsquo; son, and drew
the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aineias great of heart, and
set it before Achilles&rsquo; feet, and lifted Aineias and swung him high from
off the earth. Over many ranks of warriors, of horses many, sprang Aineias
soaring in the hand of the god, and lighted at the farthest verge of the battle
of many onsets, where the Kaukones were arraying them for the fight. Then hard
beside him came Poseidon, Shaker of earth, and spake aloud to him winged words:
&ldquo;Aineias, what god is it that biddeth thee fight infatuate against
Peleus&rsquo; vehement son, who is both a better man than thou and dearer to
Immortals? Rather withdraw thee whensoever thou fallest in with him, lest even
contrary to thy fate thou enter the house of Hades. But when Achilles shall
have met his death and doom, then be thou of good courage to fight among the
foremost, for there shall none other of the Achaians slay thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke, and left him there, when he had shown him all these things. Then
quickly from Achilles&rsquo; eyes he purged the magic mist; and he stared with
wide eyes, and in trouble spake unto his proud soul: &ldquo;Ha! verily a great
marvel behold I here with mine eyes. My spear lieth here upon the ground, nor
can I anywise see the man at whom I hurled it with intent to slay him. Truly
then is Aineias likewise dear to the immortal gods, howbeit I deemed that his
boosting thereof was altogether vanity. Away with him! not again will he find
heart to make trial of me, now that once more he has escaped death to his joy.
But come, I will call on the warlike Danaans and go forth to make trial of some
other Trojan face to face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and leapt along the lines, and called upon each man: &ldquo;No longer
stand afar from the men of Troy, noble Achaians, but come let man match man and
throw his soul into the fight. Hard is it for me, though I be strong, to assail
so vast a folk and fight them all: not even Ares, though an immortal god, nor
Athene, could plunge into the jaws of such a fray and toil therein. But to my
utmost power with hands and feet and strength no whit, I say, will I be slack,
nay, never so little, but right through their line will I go forward, nor deem
I that any Trojan shall be glad who shall come nigh my spear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he urging them. But to the Trojans glorious Hector called aloud, and
proclaimed that he would go forth against Achilles: &ldquo;High-hearted
Trojans, fear not Peleus&rsquo; son. I too in words could fight even Immortals,
but with the spear it were hard, for they are stronger far. Neither shall
Achilles accomplish all his talk, but part thereof he is to accomplish, and
part to break asunder in the midst. And against him will I go forth, though the
hands of him be even as fire, yea though his hands be as fire and his
fierceness as the flaming steel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he urging them, and the Trojans raised their spears for battle; and
their fierceness was mingled confusedly, and the battle-cry arose. Then Phoebus
Apollo stood by Hector and spake to him: &ldquo;Hector, no longer challenge
Achilles at all before the lines, but in the throng await him and from amid the
roar of the battle, lest haply he spear thee or come near and smite thee with
his sword.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and Hector again fell back into the crowd of men, for he was
amazed when he heard the sound of a god&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
But Achilles sprang in among the Trojans, his heart clothed with strength,
crying his terrible cry, and first he took Iphition, Otrynteus&rsquo; valiant
son, a leader of much people, born of a Naiad nymph to Otrynteus waster of
cities, beneath snowy Tmolos, in Hyde&rsquo;s rich domain. Him as he came right
on did goodly Achilles smite with his hurled spear, down through the midst of
his head, and it was rent asunder utterly. And he fell with a crash, and goodly
Achilles exulted over him; &ldquo;here is thy death, thy birth was on the
Gygaian lake, where is thy sire&rsquo;s demesne, by Hyllos rich in fish and
eddying Hermos.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he exultant, but darkness fell upon the eyes of Iphition: him the
chariots of the Achaians clave with their tires asunder in the forefront of the
battle, and over him Achilles pierced in the temples, through his
bronze-cheeked helmet, Demoleon, brave stemmer of battle, Antenor&rsquo;s son.
No stop made the bronze helmet, but therethrough sped the spear-head and clave
the bone, and the brain within was all scattered: that stroke made ending of
his zeal. Then Hippodamas, as he leapt from his chariot and fled before him,
Achilles wounded in the back with his spear: and he breathed forth his spirit
with a roar, as when a dragged bull roareth that the young men drag to the
altar of the Lord of Helike; for in such hath the Earthshaker his delight: thus
roared Hippodamas as from his bones fled forth his haughty spirit. But Achilles
with his spear went on after godlike Polydoros, Priam&rsquo;s son. Him would
his sire continually forbid to fight, for that among his children he was
youngest born and best beloved, and overcame all in fleetness of foot. Just
then in boyish folly, displaying the swiftness of his feet, he was rushing
through the forefighters, until he lost his life. Him in the midst did
fleet-footed noble Achilles smite with a javelin, in his back as he darted by,
where his belt&rsquo;s golden buckles clasped, and the breast and back plates
overlapped: and right through beside the navel went the spear-head, and he fell
on his knee with a cry, and dark cloud covered him round about, and he clasped
his bowels to him with his hands as he sank.
</p>

<p>
Then when Hector saw his brother Polydoros clasping his bowels with his hands,
and sinking to the earth, a mist fell over his eyes, nor longer might he endure
to range so far apart, but he came up against Achilles brandishing his sharp
spear, and like flame of fire. And Achilles when he saw him, sprang up, and
spake exultingly: &ldquo;Behold the man who hath deepest stricken into my soul,
who slew my dear-prized friend; not long shall we now shrink from each other
along the highways of the war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and looking grimly spake unto goodly Hector: &ldquo;Come thou near,
that the sooner thou mayest arrive at the goal of death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then to him, unterrified, said Hector of the glancing helm: &ldquo;Son of
Peleus, think not with words to affright me as a child, since I too know myself
how to speak taunts and unjust speech. And I know that thou art a man of might,
and a far better man than I. Yet doth this issue lie in the lap of the gods,
whether I though weaker shall take thy life with my hurled spear, for mine too
hath been found keen ere now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and poised his spear and hurled it, and Athene with a breath turned it
back from glorious Achilles, breathing very lightly; and it came back to goodly
Hector, and fell there before his feet. Then Achilles set fiercely upon him,
eager to slay him, crying his terrible cry. But Apollo caught Hector up, very
easily, as a god may, and hid him in thick mist. Thrice then did fleet-footed
noble Achilles make onset with his spear of bronze, and thrice smote the thick
mist. [But when the fourth time he had come godlike on,] then with dread shout
he spake to him winged words: &ldquo;Dog, thou art now again escaped from
death; yet came ill very nigh thee; but now hath Phoebus Apollo saved thee, to
whom thou must surely pray when thou goest forth amid the clash of spears.
Verily I will slay thee yet when I meet thee hereafter, if any god is helper of
me too. Now will I make after the rest, whomsoever I may seize.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus speaking he pierced Dryops in the midst of his neck with his spear, and he
fell down before his feet. But he left him where he lay, and hurled at Demuchos
Philetor&rsquo;s son, a good man and a tall, and stayed him with a stroke upon
his knees; then smote him with his mighty sword and reft him of life. Then
springing on Laogonos and Dardanos, sons of Bias, he thrust both from their
chariot to the ground, one with a spear-cast smiting and the other in close
battle with his sword. Then Tros, Alastor&rsquo;s son—he came and clasped his
knees to pray him to spare him, and let him live, and slay him not, having
compassion on his like age, fond fool, and knew not that he might not gain his
prayers; for nowise soft of heart or tender was that man, but of fierce
mood—with his hands he touched Achilles&rsquo; knees, eager to entreat him, but
he smote him in the liver with his sword, and his liver fell from him, and
black blood therefrom filled his bosom, and he swooned, and darkness covered
his eyes. Then Achilles came near and struck Mulios in the ear, and right
through the other ear went the bronze spear-head. Then he smote Agenor&rsquo;s
son Echeklos on the midst of the head with his hilted sword, and all the sword
grew hot thereat with blood; and dark death seized his eyes, and forceful fate.
Then next Deukalion, just where the sinews of the elbow join, there pierced he
him through the forearm with his bronze spear-head; so abode he with his arm
weighed down, beholding death before him; and Achilles smiting the neck with
his sword swept far both head and helm, and the marrow rose out of the
backbone, and the corpse lay stretched upon the earth. Then went he onward
after Peires&rsquo; noble son, Rhigmos, who had come from deep-soiled Thrace:
him in the midst he smote with his hurled javelin, and the point fixed in his
lung, and he fell forth of his chariot. And Areithoos his squire, as he turned
the horses round, he pierced in the back with his sharp spear, and thrust him
from the car, and the horse ran wild with fear.
</p>

<p>
As through deep glens rageth fierce fire on some parched mountain-side, and the
deep forest burneth, and the wind driving it whirleth every way the flame, so
raged he every way with his spear, as it had been a god, pressing hard on the
men he slew; and the black earth ran with blood. For even as when one yoketh
wide-browed bulls to tread white barley in a stablished threshing-floor, and
quickly is it trodden out beneath the feet of the loud-lowing bulls, thus
beneath great-hearted Achilles his whole-hooved horses trampled corpses and
shields together; and with blood all the axletree below was sprinkled and the
rims that ran around the car, for blood-drops from the horses&rsquo; hooves
splashed them, and blood-drops from the tires of the wheels. But the son of
Peleus pressed on to win him glory, flecking with gore his irresistible hands.
