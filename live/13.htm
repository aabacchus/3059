Poseidon stirreth up the Achaians to defend the ships. The valour of Idomeneus.
</p>

<p>
Now Zeus, after that he had brought the Trojans and Hector to the ships, left
them to their toil and endless labour there, but otherwhere again he turned his
shining eyes, and looked upon the land of the Thracian horsebreeders, and the
Mysians, fierce fighters hand to hand, and the proud Hippemolgoi that drink
mare&rsquo;s milk, and the Abioi, the most righteous of men. To Troy no more at
all he turned his shining eyes, for he deemed in his heart that not one of the
Immortals would draw near, to help either Trojans or Danaans.
</p>

<p>
But the mighty Earth-shaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled on the
war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace, for thence all
Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of Priam, and the ships of
the Achaians. Thither did he go from the sea and sate him down, and he had pity
on the Achaians, that they were subdued to the Trojans, and strong was his
anger against Zeus.
</p>

<p>
Then forthwith he went down from the rugged hill, faring with swift steps, and
the high hills trembled, and the woodland, beneath the immortal footsteps of
Poseidon as he moved. Three strides he made, and with the fourth he reached his
goal, even Aigae, and there was his famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his
glistering golden mansions builded, imperishable for ever. Thither went he, and
let harness to the car his bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with
their golden manes. He girt his own golden array about his body, and seized the
well-wrought lash of gold, and mounted his chariot, and forth he drove across
the waves. And the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on all sides out of the
deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with gladness the sea stood asunder,
and swiftly they sped, and the axle of bronze was not wetted beneath, and the
bounding steeds bare him on to the ships of the Achaians.
</p>

<p>
Now there is a spacious cave in the depths of the deep mere, between Tenedos
and rugged Imbros; there did Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth, stay his
horses, and loosed them out of the chariot, and cast before them ambrosial food
to graze withal, and golden tethers he bound about their hooves, tethers
neither to be broken nor loosed, that there the horses might continually await
their lord&rsquo;s return. And he went to the host of the Achaians.
</p>

<p>
Now the Trojans like flame or storm-wind were following in close array, with
fierce intent, after Hector, son of Priam. With shouts and cries they came, and
thought to take the ships of the Achaians, and to slay thereby all the bravest
of the host. But Poseidon, that girdleth the world, the Shaker of the earth,
was urging on the Argives, and forth he came from the deep salt sea, in form
and untiring voice like unto Kalchas. First he spake to the two Aiantes, that
themselves were eager for battle: &ldquo;Ye Aiantes twain, ye shall save the
people of the Achaians, if ye are mindful of your might, and reckless of chill
fear. For verily I do not otherwhere dread the invincible hands of the Trojans,
that have climbed the great wall in their multitude, nay, the well-greaved
Achaians will hold them all at bay; but hereby verily do I greatly dread lest
some evil befall us, even here where that furious one is leading like a flame
of fire, Hector, who boasts him to be son of mighty Zeus. Nay, but here may
some god put it into the hearts of you twain, to stand sturdily yourselves, and
urge others to do the like; thereby might ye drive him from the fleet-faring
ships, despite his eagerness, yea, even if the Olympian himself is rousing him
to war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Therewith the Shaker of the world, the girdler of the earth, struck the twain
with his staff, and filled them with strong courage, and their limbs he made
light, and their feet, and their hands withal. Then, even as a swift-winged
hawk speeds forth to fly, poised high above a tall sheer rock, and swoops to
chase some other bird across the plain, even so Poseidon sped from them, the
Shaker of the world. And of the twain Oileus&rsquo; son, the swift-footed Aias,
was the first to know the god, and instantly he spake to Aias, son of Telamon:
&ldquo;Aias, since it is one of the gods who hold Olympus, that in the
semblance of a seer commands us now to fight beside the ships-not Kalchas is
he, the prophet and sooth-sayer, for easily I knew the tokens of his feet and
knees as he turned away, and the gods are easy to discern—lo, then mine own
heart within my breast is more eagerly set on war and battle, and my feet
beneath and my hands above are lusting for the fight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Aias, son of Telamon, answered him saying: &ldquo;Even so, too, my hands
invincible now rage about the spear-shaft, and wrath has risen within me, and
both my feet are swift beneath me; yea, I am keen to meet, even in single
fight, the ceaseless rage of Hector son of Priam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So they spake to each other, rejoicing in the delight of battle, which the god
put in their heart. Then the girdler of the earth stirred up the Achaians that
were in the rear and were renewing their strength beside the swift ships. Their
limbs were loosened by their grievous toil, yea, and their souls filled with
sorrow at the sight of the Trojans, that had climbed over the great wall in
their multitude. And they looked on them, and shed tears beneath their brows,
thinking that never would they escape destruction. But the Shaker of the earth
right easily came among them, and urged on the strong battalions of warriors.
Teukros first he came and summoned, and Leitos, and the hero Peneleos, and
Thoas, and Deipyros, and Meriones, and Antilochos, lords of the war-cry, all
these he spurred on with winged words: &ldquo;Shame on you, Argives, shame, ye
striplings, in your battle had I trusted for the salvation of our ships. But if
you are to withdraw from grievous war, now indeed the day doth shine that shall
see us conquered by the Trojans. Out on it, for verily a great marvel is this
that mine eyes behold, a terrible thing that methought should never come to
pass, the Trojans advancing against our ships! Of yore they were like fleeting
hinds, that in the wild wood are the prey of jackals, and pards, and wolves,
and wander helpless, strengthless, empty of the joy of battle. Even so the
Trojans of old cared never to wait and face the wrath and the hands of the
Achaians, not for a moment. But now they are fighting far from the town, by the
hollow ships, all through the baseness of our leader and the remissness of the
people, who, being at strife with the chief, have no heart to defend the
swift-faring ships, nay, thereby they are slain. But if indeed and in truth the
hero Agamemnon, the wide-ruling son of Atreus, is the very cause of all, for
that he did dishonour the swift-footed son of Peleus, not even so may we
refrain in any wise from war. Nay, let us right our fault with speed, for
easily righted are the hearts of the brave. No longer do ye well to refrain
from impetuous might, all ye that are the best men of the host. I myself would
not quarrel with one that, being a weakling, abstained from war, but with you I
am heartily wroth. Ah, friends, soon shall ye make the mischief more through
this remissness,—but let each man conceive shame in his heart, and indignation,
for verily great is the strife that hath arisen. Lo, the mighty Hector of the
loud war-cry is fighting at the ships, and the gates and the long bar he hath
burst in sunder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On this wise did the Earth-enfolder call to and spur on the Achaians. And
straightway they made a stand around the two Aiantes, strong bands that Ares
himself could not enter and make light of, nor Athene that marshals the host.
Yea, they were the chosen best that abode the Trojans and goodly Hector, and
spear on spear made close-set fence, and shield on serried shield, buckler
pressed on buckler, and helm on helm, and man on man. The horse-hair crests on
the bright helmet-ridges touched each other as they nodded, so close they stood
each by other, and spears brandished in bold hands were interlaced; and their
hearts were steadfast and lusted for battle.
</p>

<p>
Then the Trojans drave forward in close array, and Hector led them, pressing
straight onwards, like a rolling rock from a cliff, that the winter-swollen
water thrusteth from the crest of a hill, having broken the foundations of the
stubborn rock with its wondrous flood; leaping aloft it flies, and the wood
echoes under it, and unstayed it runs its course, till it reaches the level
plain, and then it rolls no more for all its eagerness,—even so Hector for a
while threatened lightly to win to the sea through the huts and the ships of
the Achaians, slaying as he came, but when he encountered the serried
battalions, he was stayed when he drew near against them. But they of the other
part, the sons of the Achaians, thrust with their swords and double-pointed
spears, and drave him forth from them, that he gave ground and reeled backward.
Then he cried with a piercing voice, calling on the Trojans: &ldquo;Trojans,
and Lykians, and close-fighting Dardanians, hold your ground, for the Achaians
will not long ward me off, nay, though they have arrayed themselves in fashion
like a tower. Rather, methinks, they will flee back before the spear, if verily
the chief of gods has set me on, the loud-thundering lord of Hera.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Therewith he spurred on the heart and spirit of each man; and Deiphobos, the
son of Priam, strode among them with high thoughts, and held in front of him
the circle of his shield, and lightly he stepped with his feet, advancing
beneath the cover of his shield. Then Meriones aimed at him with a shining
spear, and struck, and missed not, but smote the circle of the bulls-hide
shield, yet no whit did he pierce it; nay, well ere that might be, the long
spear-shaft snapped in the socket. Now Deiphobos was holding off from him the
bulls-hide shield, and his heart feared the lance of wise Meriones, but that
hero shrunk back among the throng of his comrades, greatly in wrath both for
the loss of victory, and of his spear, that he had shivered. So he set forth to
go to the huts and the ships of the Achaians, to bring a long spear, that he
had left in his hut.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the others were fighting on, and there arose an inextinguishable cry.
First Teukros, son of Telamon, slew a man, the spearman Imbrios, the son of
Mentor rich in horses. In Pedaion he dwelt, before the coming of the sons of
the Achaians, and he had for wife a daughter of Priam, born out of wedlock,
Medesikaste; but when the curved ships of the Danaans came, he returned again
to Ilios, and was pre-eminent among the Trojans, and dwelt with Priam, who
honoured him like his own children. Him the son of Telemon pierced below the
ear with his long lance, and plucked back the spear. Then he fell like an ash
that on the crest of a far-seen hill is smitten with the axe of bronze, and
brings its delicate foliage to the ground; even so he fell, and round him rang
his armour bedight with bronze. Then Teukros rushed forth, most eager to strip
his armour, and Hector cast at him as he came with his shining spear. But
Teukros, steadily regarding him, avoided by a little the spear of bronze; so
Hector struck Amphimachos, son of Kteatos, son of Aktor, in the breast with the
spear, as he was returning to the battle. With a crash he fell, and his armour
rang upon him.
</p>

<p>
Then Hector sped forth to tear from the head of great-hearted Amphimachos the
helmet closely fitted to his temples, but Aias aimed at Hector as he came, with
a shining spear, yet in no wise touched his body, for he was all clad in dread
armour of bronze; but he smote the boss of his shield, and drave him back by
main force, and he gave place from behind the two dead men, and the Achaians
drew them out of the battle. So Stichios and goodly Menestheus, leaders of the
Athenians, conveyed Amphimachos back among the host of the Achaians, but
Imbrios the two Aiantes carried, with hearts full of impetuous might. And as
when two lions have snatched away a goat from sharp-toothed hounds, and carry
it through the deep thicket, holding the body on high above the ground in their
jaws, so the two warrior Aiantes held Imbrios aloft and spoiled his arms. Then
the son of Oileus cut his head from his delicate neck, in wrath for the sake of
Amphimachos, and sent it rolling like a ball through the throng, and it dropped
in the dust before the feet of Hector.
</p>

<p>
Then verily was Poseidon wroth at heart, when his sol&rsquo;s son fell in the
terrible fray. [Kteatos, father of Amphimachos, was Poseidol&rsquo;s son.] So
he set forth to go by the huts and the ships of the Achaians, to spur on the
Danaans, and sorrows he was contriving for the Trojans. Then Idomeneus,
spearman renowned, met him on his way from his comrade that had but newly
returned to him out of the battle, wounded on the knee with the sharp bronze.
Him his comrades carried forth, and Idomeneus gave charge to the leeches, and
so went on to his hut, for he still was eager to face the war. Then the mighty
Shaker of the earth addressed him, in the voice of Thoas, son of Andraimon,
that ruled over the Aitolians in all Pleuron, and mountainous Kalydon, and was
honoured like a god by the people: &ldquo;Idomeneus, thou counsellor of the
Cretans, say, whither have thy threats fared, wherewith the sons of the
Achaians threatened the Trojans?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, answered him again: &ldquo;O Thaos, now
is there no man to blame, that I wot of, for we all are skilled in war. Neither
is there any man that spiritless fear holds aloof, nor any that gives place to
cowardice, and shuns the cruel war, nay, but even thus, methinks, must it have
seemed good to almighty Kronion, even that the Achaians should perish nameless
here, far away from Argos. But Thoas, seeing that of old thou wert staunch, and
dost spur on some other man, wheresoever thou mayst see any give ground,
therefore slacken not now, but call aloud to every warrior.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth, answered him again: &ldquo;Idomeneus,
never may that man go forth out of Troy-land, but here may he be the sport of
dogs, who this day wilfully is slack in battle. Nay, come, take thy weapons and
away: herein we must play the man together, if any avail there may be, though
we are no more than two. Ay, and very cowards get courage from company, but we
twain know well how to battle even with the brave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Therewith the god went back again into the strife of men, but Idomeneus, so
soon as he came to his well-builded hut, did on his fair armour about his body,
and grasped two spears, and set forth like the lightning that Kronion seizes in
his hand and brandishes from radiant Olympus, showing forth a sign to mortal
men, and far seen are the flames thereof. Even so shone the bronze about the
breast of Idomeneus as he ran, and Meriones, his good squire, met him, while he
was still near his hut,—he was going to bring his spear of bronze,—and mighty
Idomeneus spake to him: &ldquo;Meriones son of Molos, fleet of foot, dearest of
my company, wherefore hast thou come hither and left the war and strife? Art
thou wounded at all, and vexed by a dart&rsquo;s point, or dost thou come with
a message for me concerning aught? Verily I myself have no desire to sit in the
huts, but to fight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then wise Meriones answered him again, saying: &ldquo;I have come to fetch a
spear, if perchance thou hast one left in the huts, for that which before I
carried I have shivered in casting at the shield of proud Deiphobos.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, answered him again: &ldquo;Spears, if
thou wilt, thou shalt find, one, ay, and twenty, standing in the hut, against
the shining side walls, spears of the Trojans whereof I have spoiled their
slain. Yea, it is not my mood to stand and fight with foemen from afar,
wherefore I have spears, and bossy shields, and helms, and corslets of splendid
sheen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then wise Meriones answered him again: &ldquo;Yea, and in mine own hut and my
black ship are many spoils of the Trojans, but not ready to my hand. Nay, for
methinks that neither am I forgetful of valour; but stand forth among the
foremost to face the glorious war, whensoever ariseth the strife of battle. Any
other, methinks, of the mail-clad Achaians should sooner forget my prowess, but
thou art he that knoweth it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, answered him again: &ldquo;I know what a
man of valour thou art, wherefore shouldst thou tell me thereof? Nay, if now
beside the ships all the best of us were being chosen for an ambush—wherein the
valour of men is best discerned; there the coward, and the brave man most
plainly declare themselves: for the colour of the coward changes often, and his
spirit cannot abide firm within him, but now he kneels on one knee, now on the
other, and rests on either foot, and his heart beats noisily in his breast, as
he thinks of doom, and his teeth chatter loudly. But the colour of the brave
man does not change, nor is he greatly afraid, from the moment that he enters
the ambush of heroes, but his prayer is to mingle instantly in woeful war. Were
we being chosen for such an ambush, I say, not even then would any man reckon
lightly of thy courage and thy strength. Nay, and even if thou wert stricken in
battle from afar, or smitten in close fight, the dart would not strike thee in
the hinder part of the neck, nor in the back, but would encounter thy breast or
belly, as thou dost press on, towards the gathering of the foremost fighters.
But come, no more let us talk thus, like children, loitering here, lest any man
be vehemently wroth, but go thou to the hut, and bring the strong spear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus he spake, and Meriones, the peer of swift Ares, quickly bare the spear of
bronze from the hut, and went after Idomeneus, with high thoughts of battle.
And even as Ares, the bane of men, goes forth into the war, and with him
follows his dear son Panic, stark and fearless, that terrifies even the hardy
warrior; and these twain leave Thrace, and harness them for fight with the
Ephyri, or the great-hearted Phlegyans, yet hearken not to both peoples, but
give honour to one only; like these gods did Meriones and Idomeneus, leaders of
men, set forth into the fight, harnessed in gleaming bronze. And Meriones spake
first to Idomeneus saying: &ldquo;Child of Deukalion, whither art thou eager to
enter into the throng: on the right of all the host, or in the centre, or on
the left? Ay, and no other where, methinks, are the flowing-haired Achaians so
like to fail in fight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, answered him again: &ldquo;In the
centre of the ships there are others to bear the brunt, the two Aiantes, and
Teukros, the best bowman of the Achaians, ay, and a good man in close fight;
these will give Hector Priam&rsquo;s son toil enough, howsoever keen he be for
battle; yea, though he be exceeding stalwart. Hard will he find it, with all
his lust for war, to overcome their strength and their hands invincible, and to
fire the ships, unless Kronion himself send down on the swift ships a burning
brand. But not to a man would he yield, the great Telamonian Aias, to a man
that is mortal and eateth Demeter&rsquo;s grain, and may be chosen with the
sword of bronze, and with hurling of great stones. Nay, not even to Achilles
the breaker of the ranks of men would he give way, not in close fight; but for
speed of foot none may in any wise strive with Achilles. But guide us twain, as
thou sayest, to the left hand of the host, that speedily we may learn whether
we are to win glory from others, or other men from us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and Meriones, the peer of swift Ares, led the way, till they came
to the host, in that place whither he bade him go.
</p>

<p>
And when the Trojans saw Idomeneus, strong as flame, and his squire with him,
and their glorious armour, they all shouted and made for him through the press.
Then their mellay began, by the sterns of the ships. And as the gusts speed on,
when shrill winds blow, on a day when dust lies thickest on the roads, and the
winds raise together a great cloud of dust, even so their battle clashed
together, and all were fain of heart to slay each other in the press with the
keen bronze. And the battle, the bane of men, bristled with the long spears,
the piercing spears they grasped, and the glitter of bronze from gleaming
helmets dazzled the eyes, and the sheen of new-burnished corslets, and shining
shields, as the men thronged all together. Right hardy of heart would he have
been that joyed and sorrowed not at the sight of this labour of battle.
</p>

<p>
Thus the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were contriving
sorrow and anguish for the heroes. Zeus desired victory for the Trojans and
Hector, giving glory to swift-footed Achilles; yet he did not wish the Achaian
host to perish utterly before Ilios, but only to give renown to Thetis and her
strong-hearted son. But Poseidon went among the Argives and stirred them to
war, stealing secretly forth from the grey salt sea: for he was sore vexed that
they were overcome by the Trojans, and was greatly in wrath against Zeus.
Verily both were of the same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was
the elder and the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid, but
secretly ever he spurred them on, throughout the host, in the likeness of a
man. These twain had strained the ends of the cords of strong strife and equal
war, and had stretched them over both Trojans and Achaians, a knot that none
might break nor undo, for the loosening of the knees of many.
</p>

<p>
Even then Idomeneus, though his hair was flecked with grey, called on the
Danaans, and leaping among the Trojans, roused their terror. For he slew
Othryoneus of Kabesos, a sojourner there, who but lately had followed after the
rumour of war, and asked in marriage the fairest of the daughters of Priam,
Kassandra, without gifts of wooing, but with promise of mighty deed, namely
that he would drive perforce out of Troy-land the sons of the Achaians. To him
the old man Priam had promised and appointed that he would give her, so he
fought trusting in his promises. And Idomeneus aimed at him with a bright
spear, and cast and smote him as he came proudly striding on, and the corslet
of bronze that he wore availed not, but the lance struck in the midst of his
belly. And he fell with a crash, and Idomeneus boasted over him, and lifted up
his voice, saying: &ldquo;Othryoneus, verily I praise thee above all mortal
men, if indeed thou shalt accomplish all that thou hast promised Priam, son of
Dardanos, that promised thee again his own daughter. Yea, and we likewise would
promise as much to thee, and fulfil it, and would give thee the fairest
daughter of the son of Atreus, and bring her from Argos, and wed her to thee,
if only thou wilt aid us to take the fair-set citadel of Ilios. Nay, follow us
that we may make a covenant of marriage by the seafaring ships, for we are no
hard exacters of gifts of wooing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Therewith the hero Idomeneus dragged him by the foot across the fierce mellay.
But Asios came to his aid, on foot before his horses that the charioteer guided
so that still their breath touched the shoulders of Asios. And the desire of
his heart was to cast at Idomeneus, who was beforehand with him, and smote him
with the spear in the throat, below the chin, and drove the point straight
through. And he fell as an oak falls, or a poplar, or tall pine tree, that
craftsmen have felled on the hills with new whetted axes, to be a ship&rsquo;s
timber; even so he lay stretched out before the horses and the chariot,
groaning, and clutching the bloody dust. And the charioteer was amazed, and
kept not his wits, as of old, and dared not turn his horses and avoid out of
the hands of foemen; and Antilochos the steadfast in war smote him, and pierced
the middle of his body with a spear. Nothing availed the corslet of bronze he
was wont to wear, but he planted the spear fast in the midst of his belly.
Therewith he fell gasping from the well-wrought chariot, and Antilochos, the
son of great-hearted Nestor, drave the horses out from the Trojans, among the
well-greaved Achaians. Then Deiphobos, in sorrow for Asios, drew very nigh
Idomeneus, and cast at him with his shining spear. But Idomeneus steadily
watching him, avoided the spear of bronze, being hidden beneath the circle of
his shield, the shield covered about with ox-hide and gleaming bronze, that he
allows bore, fitted with two arm-rods: under this he crouched together, and the
spear of bronze flew over. And his shield rang sharply, as the spear grazed
thereon. Yet it flew not vainly from the heavy hand of Deiphobos, but smote
Hypsenor, son of Hippasos, the shepherd of the hosts, in the liver, beneath the
midriff, and instantly unstrung his knees. And Deiphobos boasted over him
terribly, crying aloud: &ldquo;Ah, verily, not unavenged lies Asios, nay,
methinks, that even on his road to Hades, strong Warden of the gate, he will
rejoice at heart, since, lo, I have sent him escort for the way!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, but grief came on the Argives by reason of his boast, and stirred
above all the soul of the wise-hearted Antilochos, yet, despite his sorrow, he
was not heedless of his dear comrade, but ran and stood over him, and covered
him with his buckler. Then two trusty companions, Mekisteus, son of Echios, and
goodly Alastor, stooped down and lifted him, and with heavy groaning bare him
to the hollow ships.
</p>

<p>
And Idomeneus relaxed not his mighty force, but ever was striving, either to
cover some one of the Trojans with black night, or himself to fall in warding
off death from the Achaians. There the dear son of Aisyetes, fosterling of
Zeus, even the hero Alkathoos, was slain, who was son-in-law of Anchises, and
had married the eldest of his daughters, Hippodameia, whom her father and her
lady mother dearly loved in the halls, for she excelled all the maidens of her
age in beauty, and skill, and in wisdom, wherefore the best man in wide Troy
took her to wife. This Alkathoos did Poseidon subdue to Idomeneus, throwing a
spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs; so that he might
neither flee backwards, nor avoid the stroke, but stood steady as a pillar, or
a tree with lofty crown of leaves, when the hero Idomeneus smote him in the
midst of the breast with the spear, and rent the coat of bronze about him, that
aforetime warded death from his body, but now rang harsh as it was rent by the
spear. And he fell with a crash, and the lance fixed in his heart, that, still
beating, shook the butt-end of the spear. Then at length mighty Ares spent its
fury there; but Idomeneus boasted terribly, and cried aloud: &ldquo;Deiphobos,
are we to deem it fair acquittal that we have slain three men for one, since
thou boastest thus? Nay, sir, but stand thou up also thyself against me, that
thou mayst know what manner of son of Zeus am I that have come hither! For Zeus
first begat Minos, the warden of Crete, and Minos got him a son, the noble
Deukalion, and Deukalion begat me, a prince over many men in wide Crete, and
now have the ships brought me hither, a bane to thee and thy father, and all
the Trojans.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus he spake, but the thoughts of Deiphobos were divided, whether he should
retreat, and call to his aid some one of the great-hearted Trojans, or should
try the adventure alone. And on this wise to his mind it seemed the better, to
go after Aineias, whom he found standing the last in the press, for Aineias was
ever wroth against goodly Priam, for that Priam gave him no honour, despite his
valour among men. So Deiphobos stood by him, and spake winged words to him:
&ldquo;Aineias, thou counsellor of the Trojans, now verily there is great need
that thou shouldst succour thy sister&rsquo;s husband, if any care for kin doth
touch thee. Nay follow, let us succour Alkathoos, thy sister&rsquo;s husband,
who of old did cherish thee in his hall, while thou wert but a little one, and
now, lo, spear-famed Idomeneus hath stripped him of his arms!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and roused the spirit in the breast of Aineias, who went to seek
Idomeneus, with high thoughts of war. But fear took not hold upon Idomeneus, as
though he had been some tender boy, but he stood at bay, like a boar on the
hills that trusteth to his strength, and abides the great assailing throng of
men in a lonely place, and he bristles up his back, and his eyes shine with
fire, while he whets his tusks, and is right eager to keep at bay both men and
hounds. Even so stood spear-famed Idomeneus at bay against Aineias, that came
to the rescue, and gave ground no whit, but called on his comrades, glancing to
Askalaphos, and Aphareus, and Deipyros, and Meriones, and Antilochos, all
masters of the war-cry; them he spurred up to battle, and spake winged words:
&ldquo;Hither, friends, and rescue me, all alone as I am, and terribly I dread
the onslaught of swift-footed Aineias, that is assailing me; for he is right
strong to destroy men in battle, and he hath the flower of youth, the greatest
avail that may be. Yea, if he and I were of like age, and in this spirit
whereof now we are, speedily should he or I achieve high victory.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and they all, being of one spirit in their hearts, stood hard by
each other, with buckler laid on shoulder. But Aineias, on the other side,
cried to his comrades, glancing to Deiphobos, and Paris, and noble Agenor, that
with him were leaders of the Trojans; and then the hosts followed them, as
sheep follow their leader to the water from the pasture, and the shepherd is
glad at heart; even so the heart of Aineias was glad in his breast, when he saw
the hosts of the people following to aid him.
</p>

<p>
Then they rushed in close fight around Alkathoos with their long spears, and
round their breasts the bronze rang terribly, as they aimed at each other in
the press, while two men of war beyond the rest, Aineias and Idomeneus, the
peers of Ares, were each striving to hew the flesh of the other with the
pitiless bronze. Now Aineias first cast at Idomeneus, who steadily watching him
avoided the spear of bronze, and the point of Aineias went quivering in the
earth, since vainly it had flown from his stalwart hand. But Idomeneus smote
Oinomaos in the midst of the belly, and brake the plate of his corslet, and the
bronze let forth the bowels through the corslet, and he fell in the dust and
clutched the earth in his palms. And Idomeneus drew forth the far-shadowing
spear from the dead, but could not avail to strip the rest of the fair armour
from his shoulders, for the darts pressed hard on him. Nay, and his feet no
longer served him firmly in a charge, nor could he rush after his own spear,
nor avoid the foe. Wherefore in close fight he still held off the pitiless day
of destiny, but in retreat: his feet no longer bore him swiftly from the
battle. And as he was slowly departing, Deiphobos aimed at him with his shining
spear, for verily he ever cherished a steadfast hatred against Idomeneus. But
this time, too, he missed him, and smote Askalapbos, the son of Enyalios, with
his dart, and the strong spear passed through his shoulder, and he fell in the
dust, and clutched the earth in his outstretched hand. But loud-voiced awful
Ares was not yet aware at all that his son had fallen in strong battle, but he
was reclining on the peak of Olympus, beneath the golden clouds, being held
there by the design of Zeus, where also were the other deathless gods,
restrained from the war.
</p>

<p>
Now the people rushed in close fight around Askalaphos, and Deiphobos tore from
Askalaphos his shining helm, but Meriones, the peer of swift Ares, leaped
forward and smote the arm of Deiphobos with his spear, and from his hand the
vizored casque fell clanging to the ground. And Meriones sprang forth
instantly, like a vulture, and drew the strong spear from the shoulder of
Deiphobos, and fell back among the throng of his comrades. But the own brother
of Deiphobos, Polites, stretched his hands round his waist, and led him forth
from the evil din of war, even till he came to the swift horses, that waited
for him behind the battle and the fight, with their charioteer, and well-dight
chariot. These bore him heavily groaning to the city, worn with his hurt, and
the blood ran down from his newly wounded arm.
</p>

<p>
But the rest still were fighting, and the war-cry rose unquenched. There
Aineias rushed on Aphareus, son of Kaletor, and struck his throat, that chanced
to be turned to him, with the keen spear, and his head dropped down and his
shield and helm fell with him, and death that slays the spirit overwhelmed him.
And Antilochos watched Thoon as he turned the other way, and leaped on him, and
wounded him, severing all the vein that runs up the back till it reaches the
neck; this he severed clean, and Thoon fell on his back in the dust, stretching
out both his hands to his comrades dear. Then Antilochos rushed on, and
stripped the armour from his shoulders, glancing around while the Trojans
gathered from here and there, and smote his wide shining shield, yet did not
avail to graze, behind the shield, the delicate flesh of Antilochos with the
pitiless bronze. For verily Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth, did guard on
every side the son of Nestor, even in the midst of the javelins. And never did
Antilochos get free of the foe, but turned him about among them, nor ever was
his spear at rest, but always brandished and shaken, and the aim of his heart
was to smite a foeman from afar, or to set on him at close quarters. But as he
was aiming through the crowd, he escaped not the ken of Adamas, son of Asios,
who smote the midst of his shield with the sharp bronze, setting on nigh at
hand; but Poseidon of the dark locks made his shaft of no avail, grudging him
the life of Antilochos. And part of the spear abode there, like a burned stake,
in the shield of Antilochos, and half lay on the earth, and back retreated
Adamas to the ranks of his comrades, avoiding Fate. But Meriones following
after him as he departed, smote him with a spear between the privy parts and
the navel, where a wound is most baneful to wretched mortals. Even there he
fixed the spear in him and he fell, and writhed about the spear, even as a bull
that herdsmen on the hills drag along perforce when they have bound him with
withes, so he when he was smitten writhed for a moment, not for long, till the
hero Meriones came near, and drew the spear out of his body. And darkness
covered his eyes.
</p>

<p>
And Helenos in close fight smote Deipyros on the temple, with a great Thracian
sword, and tore away the helm, and the helm, being dislodged, fell on the
ground, and one of the Achaians in the fight picked it up as it rolled between
his feet. But dark night covered the eyes of Deipyros.
</p>

<p>
Then grief took hold of the son of Atreus, Menelaos of the loud war-cry, and he
went with a threat against the warrior Helenos, the prince, shaking his sharp
spear, while the other drew the centre-piece of his bow. And both at once were
making ready to let fly, one with his sharp spear, the other with the arrow
from the string. Then the son of Priam smote Menelaos on the breast with his
arrow, on the plate of the corslet, and off flew the bitter arrow. Even as from
a broad shovel in a great threshing floor, fly the black-skinned beans and
pulse, before the whistling wind, and the stress of the winnower&rsquo;s
shovel, even so from the corslet of the renowned Menelaos flew glancing far
aside the bitter arrow. But the son of Atreus, Menelaos of the loud war-cry,
smote the hand of Helenos wherein he held the polished bow, and into the bow,
clean through the hand, was driven the spear of bronze. Back he withdrew to the
ranks of his comrades, avoiding Fate, with his hand hanging down at his side,
for the ashen spear dragged after him. And the great-hearted Agenor drew the
spear from his hand, and himself bound up the hand with a band of twisted
sheep&rsquo;s-wool, a sling that a squire carried for him, the shepherd of the
host.
</p>

<p>
Then Peisandros made straight for renowned Menelaos, but an evil Fate was
leading him to the end of Death; by thee, Menelaos, to be overcome in the dread
strife of battle. Now when the twain had come nigh in onset upon each other,
the son of Atreus missed, and his spear was turned aside, but Peisandros smote
the shield of renowned Menelaos, yet availed not to drive the bronze clean
through, for the wide shield caught it, and the spear brake in the socket, yet
Peisandros rejoiced in his heart, and hoped for the victory. But the son of
Atreus drew his silver-studded sword, and leaped upon Peisandros. And
Peisandros, under his shield, clutched his goodly axe of fine bronze, with long
and polished haft of olive-wood, and the twain set upon each other. Then
Peisandros smote the crest of the helmet shaded with horse hair, close below
the very plume, but Menelaos struck the other, as he came forward, on the brow,
above the base of the nose, and the bones cracked, and the eyes, all bloody,
fell at his feet in the dust. Then he bowed and fell, and Menelaos set his foot
on his breast, and stripped him of his arms, and triumphed, saying: &ldquo;Even
thus then surely, ye will leave the ships of the Danaans of the swift steeds,
ye Trojans overweening, insatiate of the dread din of war. Yea, and ye shall
not lack all other reproof and shame, wherewith ye made me ashamed, ye hounds
of evil, having no fear in your hearts of the strong wrath of loud-thundering
Zeus, the god of guest and host, who one day will destroy your steep citadel. O
ye that wantonly carried away my wedded wife and many of my possessions, when
ye were entertained by her, now again ye are fain to throw ruinous fire on the
seafaring ships, and to slay the Achaian heroes. Nay, but ye will yet refrain
you from battle, for as eager as ye be. O Zeus, verily they say that thou dost
excel in wisdom all others, both gods and men, and all these things are from
thee. How wondrously art thou favouring men of violence, even the Trojans,
whose might is ever iniquitous, nor can they have their fill of the din of
equal war. Of all things there is satiety, yea, even of love and sleep, and of
sweet song, and dance delectable, whereof a man would sooner have his fill than
of war, but the Trojans are insatiable of battle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus noble Menelaos spake, and stripped the bloody arms from the body, and gave
them to his comrades, and instantly himself went forth again, and mingled in
the forefront of the battle. Then Harpalion, the son of king Pylaimenes, leaped
out against him, Harpalion that followed his dear father to Troy, to the war,
nor ever came again to his own country. He then smote the middle of the shield
of Atreus&rsquo; son with his spear, in close fight, yet availed not to drive
the bronze clean through, but fell back into the host of his comrades, avoiding
Fate, glancing round every way, lest one should wound his flesh with the
bronze. But Meriones shot at him as he retreated with a bronze-shod arrow, and
smote him in the right buttock, and the arrow went right through the bladder
and came out under the bone. And sitting down, even there, in the arms of his
dear comrades, he breathed away his soul, lying stretched like a worm on the
earth, and out flowed the black blood, and wetted the ground. And the
Paphlagonians great of heart, tended him busily, and set him in a chariot, and
drove him to sacred Ilios sorrowing, and with them went his father, shedding
tears, and there was no atonement for his dead son.
</p>

<p>
Now Paris was very wroth at heart by reason of his slaying, for he had been his
host among the many Paphlagonions, wherefore, in wrath for his sake, he let fly
a bronze-shod arrow. Now there was a certain Euchenor, the son of Polyidos the
seer, a rich man and a good, whose dwelling was in Corinth. And well he knew
his own ruinous fate, when he went on ship-board, for often would the old man,
the good Polyidos, tell him, that he must either perish of a sore disease in
his halls, or go with the ships of the Achaians, and be overcome by the
Trojans. Wherefore he avoided at once the heavy war-fine of the Achaians, and
the hateful disease, that so he might not know any anguish. This man did Paris
smite beneath the jaw and under the ear, and swiftly his spirit departed from
his limbs, and, lo, dread darkness overshadowed him.
</p>

<p>
So they fought like flaming fire, but Hector, beloved of Zeus had not heard nor
knew at all that, on the left of the ships, his host was being subdued by the
Argives, and soon would the Achaians have won renown, so mighty was the Holder
and Shaker of the earth that urged on the Argives; yea, and himself mightily
defended them. But Hector kept where at first he had leaped within the walls
and the gate, and broken the serried ranks of shield-bearing Danaans, even
where were the ships of Aias and Protesilaos, drawn up on the beach of the
hoary sea, while above the wall was builded lowest, and thereby chiefly the
heroes and their horses were raging in battle.
</p>

<p>
There the Boiotians, and Ionians with trailing tunics, and Lokrians and
Phthians and illustrious Epeians scarcely availed to stay his onslaught on the
ships, nor yet could they drive back from them noble Hector, like a flame of
fire. And there were the picked men of the Athenians; among them Menestheus son
of Peteos was the leader; and there followed with him Pheidas and Stichios, and
brave Bias, while the Epeians were led by Meges, son of Phyleus, and Amphion
and Drakios, and in front of the Phthians were Medon, and Podarkes resolute in
war. Now the one, Medon, was the bastard son of noble Oileus, and brother of
Aias, and he dwelt in Phylake, far from his own country, for that he had slain
a man, the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, wife of Oileus. But the other,
Podarkes, was the son of Iphiklos son of Phylakos, and they in their armour, in
the van of the great-hearted Phthians, were defending the ships, and fighting
among the Boiotians.
</p>

<p>
Now never at all did Aias, the swift son of Oileus, depart from the side of
Aias, son of Telamon, nay, not for an instant, but even as in fallow land two
wine-dark oxen with equal heart strain at the shapen plough, and round the
roots of their horns springeth up abundant sweat, and nought sunders them but
the polished yoke, as they labour through the furrow, till the end of the
furrow brings them up, so stood the two Aiantes close by each other. Now verily
did many and noble hosts of his comrades follow with the son of Telamon, and
bore his shield when labour and sweat came upon his limbs. But the Lokrians
followed not with the high-hearted son of Oileus, for their hearts were not
steadfast in close brunt of battle, seeing that they had no helmets of bronze,
shadowy with horse-hair plumes, nor round shields, nor ashen spears, but
trusting in bows and well-twisted slings of sheep&rsquo;s wool, they followed
with him to Ilios. Therewith, in the war, they shot thick and fast, and brake
the ranks of the Trojans. So the one party in front contended with the Trojans,
and with Hector arrayed in bronze, while the others from behind kept shooting
from their ambush, and the Trojans lost all memory of the joy of battle, for
the arrows confounded them.
</p>

<p>
There then right ruefully from the ships and the huts would the Trojans have
withdrawn to windy Ilios, had not Polydamas come near valiant Hector and said:
&ldquo;Hector, thou art hard to be persuaded by them that would counsel thee;
for that god has given thee excellence in the works of war, therefore in
council also thou art fain to excel other men in knowledge. But in nowise wilt
thou be able to take everything on thyself. For to one man has god given for
his portion the works of war, [to another the dance, to another the lute and
song,] but in the heart of yet another hath far-seeing Zeus placed an excellent
understanding, whereof many men get gain, yea he saveth many an one, and
himself best knoweth it. But, lo, I will speak even as it seemeth best to me.
Behold all about thee the circle of war is blazing, but the great-hearted
Trojans, now that they have got down the wall, are some with their arms
standing aloof and some are fighting, few men against a host, being scattered
among the ships. Nay, withdraw thee, and call hither all the best of the
warriors. Thereafter shall we take all counsel carefully, whether we should
fall on the ships of many benches, if indeed god willeth to give us victory, or
after counsel held, should return unharmed from the ships. For verily I fear
lest the Achaians repay their debt of yesterday, since by the ships there
tarrieth a man insatiate of war, and never, methinks, will he wholly stand
aloof from battle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake Polydamas, and his safe counsel pleased Hector well, who spake to him
winged words and said: &ldquo;Polydamas, do thou stay here all the best of the
host, but I will go thither to face the war, and swiftly will return again,
when I have straitly laid on them my commands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and set forth, in semblance like a snowy mountain, and shouting
aloud he flew through the Trojans and allies. And they all sped to Polydamas,
the kindly son of Panthoos, when they heard the voice of Hector. But he went
seeking Deiphobos, and the strong prince Helenos, and Adamas son of Asios, and
Asios son of Hyrtakos, among the warriors in the foremost line, if anywhere he
might find them. But them he found not at all unharmed, nor free of bane, but,
lo, some among the sterns of the ships of the Achaians lay lifeless, slain by
the hands of the Argives, and some were within the wall wounded by thrust or
cast. But one he readily found, on the left of the dolorous battle, goodly
Alexandros, the lord of fair-tressed Helen, heartening his comrades and
speeding them to war. And he drew near to him, and addressed him with words of
shame: &ldquo;Thou evil Paris, fairest of face, thou that lustest for women,
thou seducer, where, prithee, are Deiphobos, and the strong prince Helenos, and
Adamas son of Asios, and Asios son of Hyrtakos, and where is Othryoneus? Now
hath all high Ilios perished utterly. Now, too, thou seest, is sheer
destruction sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then godlike Alexandros answered him again saying: &ldquo;Hector, since thy
mind is to blame one that is blameless, some other day might I rather withdraw
me from the war, since my mother bare not even me wholly a coward. For from the
time that thou didst gather the battle of thy comrades about the ships, from
that hour do we abide here, and war with the Danaans ceaselessly; and our
comrades concerning whom thou inquirest are slain. Only Deiphobos and the
strong prince Helenos have both withdrawn, both of them being wounded in the
hand with long spears, for Kronion kept death away from them. But now lead on,
wheresoever thy heart and spirit bid thee, and we will follow with thee
eagerly, nor methinks shall we lack for valour, as far as we have strength; but
beyond his strength may no man fight, howsoever eager he be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake the hero, and persuaded his brother&rsquo;s heart, and they went forth
where the war and din were thickest, round Kebriones, and noble Polydamas, and
Phalkes, and Orthaios, and godlike Polyphetes, and Palmys, and Askanios, and
Morys, son of Hippotion, who had come in their turn, out of deep-soiled
Askanie, on the morn before, and now Zeus urged them to fight. And these set
forth like the blast of violent winds, that rushes earthward beneath the
thunder of Zeus, and with marvellous din doth mingle with the salt sea, and
therein are many swelling waves of the loud roaring sea, arched over and white
with foam, some vanward, others in the rear; even so the Trojans arrayed in van
and rear and shining with bronze, followed after their leaders.
</p>

<p>
And Hector son of Priam was leading them, the peer of Ares, the bane of men. In
front he held the circle of his shield, thick with hides, and plates of beaten
bronze, and on his temples swayed his shining helm. And everywhere he went in
advance and made trial of the ranks, if perchance they would yield to him as he
charged under cover of his shield. But he could not confound the heart within
the breast of the Achaians. And Aias, stalking with long strides, challenged
him first: &ldquo;Sir, draw nigh, wherefore dost thou vainly try to dismay the
Argives? We are in no wise ignorant of war, but by the cruel scourge of Zeus
are we Achaians vanquished. Surely now thy heart hopes utterly to spoil the
ships, but we too have hands presently to hold our own. Verily your peopled
city will long ere that beneath our hands be taken and sacked. But for thee, I
tell thee that the time is at hand, when thou shalt pray in thy flight to Zeus,
and the other immortal gods, that thy fair-maned steeds may be fleeter than
falcons: thy steeds that are to bear thee to the city, as they storm in dust
across the plain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And even as he spake, a bird flew forth on the right hand, an eagle of lofty
flight, and the host of the Achaians shouted thereat, encouraged by the omen,
but renowned Hector answered: &ldquo;Aias, thou blundering boaster, what sayest
thou! Would that indeed I were for ever as surely the son of aegis-bearing
Zeus, and that my mother were lady Hera, and that I were held in such honour as
Apollo and Athene, as verily this day is to bring utter evil on all the
Argives! And thou among them shalt be slain, if thou hast the heart to await my
long spear, which shall rend thy lily skin, and thou shalt glut with thy fat
and flesh the birds and dogs of the Trojans, falling among the ships of the
Achaians.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake and led the way, and they followed with wondrous din, and the whole
host shouted behind. And the Argives on the other side answered with a shout,
and forgot not their valiance, but abode the onslaught of the bravest of the
Trojans. And the cry of the two hosts went up through the higher air, to the
splendour of Zeus.
