How Achilles and Agamemnon were reconciled before the assembly of the Achaians,
and Achilles went forth with them to battle.
</p>

<p>
Now Morning saffron-robed arose from the streams of Ocean to bring light to
gods and men, and Thetis came to the ships, bearing his gift from the god. Her
dear son she found fallen about Patroklos and uttering loud lament; and round
him many of his company made moan. And the bright goddess stood beside him in
their midst, and clasped her hand in his and spake and called upon his name:
&ldquo;My child, him who lieth here we must let be, for all our pain, for by
the will of gods from the beginning was he brought low. But thou take from
Hephaistos arms of pride, arms passing goodly, such as no man on his shoulders
yet hath borne.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake the goddess and in front of Aehifies laid the arms, and they rang
all again in their glory. And awe fell on all the Myrmidons, nor dared any to
gaze thereon, for they were awe-stricken. But when Achilles looked thereon,
then came fury upon him the more, and his eyes blazed terribly forth as it were
a flame beneath their lids: glad was he as he held in his hands that splendid
gift of a god. But when he had satisfied his soul in gazing on the glory of the
arms, straightway to his mother spake he winged words: &ldquo;My mother, the
arms the god has given are such as it beseemeth that the work of Immortals
should be, and that no mortal man should have wrought. Now therefore will I arm
me in them, but I have grievous fear lest meantime on the gashed wounds of
Menoitios&rsquo; valiant son flies light and breed worms therein, and defile
his corpse—for the life is slain out of him—and so all his flesh shall
rot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then answered him Thetis, goddess of the silver feet: &ldquo;Child, have no
care for this within thy mind. I will see to ward from him the cruel tribes of
flies which prey on men slain in fight: for even though he lie till a whole
year&rsquo;s course be run, yet his flesh shall be sound continually, or better
even than now. But call thou the Achaian warriors to the place of assembly, and
unsay thy wrath against Agamemnon shepherd of the host, and then arm swiftly
for battle, and clothe thee with thy strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying she filled him with adventurous might, while on Patroklos she shed
ambrosia and red nectar through his nostrils, that his flesh might abide the
same continually.
</p>

<p>
But noble Achilles went down the beach of the sea, crying his terrible cry, and
roused the Achaian warriors. And they who before were wont to abide in the
circle of the ships, and they who were helmsmen and kept the steerage of the
ships, or were stewards there and dealt out food, even these came then to the
place of assembly, because Achilles was come forth, after long ceasing from
grievous war. Limping came two of Ares&rsquo; company, Tydeus&rsquo; son
staunch in fight and noble Odysseus, each leaning on his spear, for their
wounds were grievous still; and they went and sate them down in the forefront
of the assembly. And last came Agamemnon king of men, with his wound upon him,
for him too in the stress of battle Kooen Antenor&rsquo;s son had wounded with
his bronze-tipped spear. But when all the Achaians were gathered, then uprose
fleet-footed Achilles and spake in their midst: &ldquo;Son of Atreus, was this
in any wise the better way for both thee and me, what time with grief at our
hearts we waxed fierce in soul-devouring strife for the sake of a girl? Would
that Artemis had slain her with her arrow at the ships, on the day whereon I
took her to me, when I had spoiled Lyrnessos; so should not then so many
Achaians have bitten the wide earth beneath their enemies&rsquo; hands, by
reason of my exceeding wrath. It hath been well for Hector and the Trojans, but
the Achaians I think shall long remember the strife that was betwixt thee and
me. But bygones will we let be, for all our pain, and curb under necessity the
spirit within our breasts. I now will stay my anger: it beseems me not
implacably for ever to be wroth; but come rouse speedily to the fight the
flowing-haired Achaians, that I may go forth against the men of Troy and put
them yet again to the proof, if they be fain to couch hard by the ships.
Methinks that some among them shall be glad to rest their knees when they are
fled out of the fierceness of the battle, and from before our spear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spake, and the well-greaved Achaians rejoiced that the great-hearted son of
Peleus had made renouncement of his wrath. Then among them spake Agamemnon king
of men, speaking from the place where he sat, not arisen to stand forth in
their midst: &ldquo;O Danaan friends and heroes, men of Ares&rsquo; company,
seemly is it to listen to him who standeth up to speak, nor behoveth it to
break in upon his words: even toward a skilled man that were hard. For amid the
uproar of many men how should one listen, or yet speak? even the
clearest-voiced speech is marred. To the son of Peleus I will declare myself,
but ye other Argives give heed, and each mark well my word. Oft have the
Achaians spoken thus to me, and upbraided me; but it is not I who am the cause,
but Zeus and Destiny and Erinys that walketh in the darkness, who put into my
soul fierce madness on the day when in the assembly I, even I, bereft Achilles
of his meed. What could I do? it is God who accomplisheth all. Eldest daughter
of Zeus is Ate who blindeth all, a power of bane: delicate are her feet, for
not upon the earth she goeth, but walketh over the heads of men, making men
fall; and entangleth this one or that. Ye even Zeus was blinded upon a time, he
who they say is greatest among gods and men; yet even him Hera with a female
wile deceived, on the day when Alkmene in fair-crowned Thebes was to bring
forth the strength of Herakles. For then proclaimed he solemnly among the gods:
&lsquo;Here me ye all, both gods and goddesses, while I utter the council of my
soul within my heart. This day shall Eileithuia, the help of travailing women,
bring to the light a man who shall be lord over all that dwell round about,
among the raise of men who are sprung of me by blood.&rsquo; And to him in
subtlety queen Hera spake: &lsquo;Though wilt play the cheat and not accomplish
thy word. Come now, Olympian, swear me a firm oath that verily and indeed shall
that man be lord over all that dwell round about, who this day shall fall
between a womal&rsquo;s feet, even he among all men who are of the lineage of
thy blood.&rsquo; So spake she, and Zeus no wise perceived her subtlety but
sware a mighty oath, and therewith was he sore blinded. For Hera darted from
Olympus&rsquo; peak and came swiftly to Achaian Argus, were she knew was the
stately wife of Sthenelos son of Perseus, who was also great with child, and
her seventh month had come. Her son Hera brought to the light, though his tale
of months was untold, but she stayed Alkmene&rsquo;s bearing and kept the
Eileithuiai from her aid. Then she brought the tidings herself and to
Kronos&rsquo; son Zeus she spake: &lsquo;Father Zeus of the bright lightning, a
word will I speak to thee for my heed. Today is born a man of valor who shall
rule among the Archives, Eurystheus, son of Sthenelos the son of Perseus, of
thy lineage; not unmeet is it that he be lord among Argives.&rsquo; She said,
but sharp pain smote him in the depths of his soul, and straightway he seized
Ate by her bright-haired head in the anger of his soul, and sware a mighty oath
that never again to Olympus and the starry heaven should Ate come, who blindeth
all alike. He said, and whirling her in his hand flung her from the starry
heaven, and quickly came she down among the works of men. Yet ever he groaned
against her when he beheld his beloved son in cruel travail at
Eurystheus&rsquo; hest. Thus also I, what time great Hector of the glancing
helm was slaying Argives at the sterns of our ships, could not be unmindful of
Ate, who blinded me at the first. But since thus blinded was I, and Zeus bereft
me of my wit, fain am I to make amends, and recompense manifold for the wrong.
Only arise thou to the battle and rouse the rest of the host. Gifts am I ready
to offer, even all that noble Odysseus went yesterday to promise in thy hut.
So, if thou wilt, stay awhile, though eager, from battle, and squires shall
take the gifts from my ship and carry them to thee, that thou mayest see that
what I give sufficeth thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then answered him Achilles swift of foot: &ldquo;Most noble son of Atreus,
Agamemnon king of men, for the gifts, to give them as it beseemeth, if so thou
wilt, or to withhold, is in thy choice. But now let us bethink us of battle
with all speed; this is no time to dally here with subtleties, for a great work
is yet undone. Once more must Achilles be seen in the forefront of the battle,
laying waste with his brazen spear the battalions of the men of Troy. Thereof
let each of you think as he fighteth with his man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: &ldquo;Nay yet, for all
thy valour, godlike Achilles, not against Ilios lead thou the sons of Achaians
fasting to fight the men of Troy, since not of short spell shall the battle be,
when once the ranks of men are met, and God shall breathe valour into both. But
bid the Achaians taste at the swift ships food and wine; for thence is vigour
and might. For no man fasting from food shall be able to fight with the foe all
day till the going down of the sun; for though his spirit be eager for battle
yet his limbs unaware grow weary, and thirst besetteth him, and hunger, and his
knees in his going fail. But the man who having his fill of food and wine
fighteth thus all day against the enemy, his heart is of good cheer within him,
nor anywise tire his limbs, ere all give back from battle. So come, disperse
the host and bid them make ready their meal. And the gifts let Agamemnon king
of men bring forth into the midst of the assembly, that all Achaians may behold
them with their eyes, and thou be glad at heart. And let him swear to thee an
oath, standing in the midst of the Argives, that he hath never gone up into the
damsel&rsquo;s bed or lain with her, [O prince, as is the wont of man with
woman]; and let thine own spirit be placable within thy breast. Then let him
make thee a rich feast of reconcilement in his hut, that thou have nothing
lacking of thy right. And thou, son of Atreus, toward others also shalt be more
righteous hereafter; for no shame it is that a man that is a king should make
amends if he have been the first to deal violently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then to him spake Agamemnon king of men: &ldquo;Son of Laertes, I rejoice to
listen to thy speech; for rightfully hast thou told over all. And the oath I am
willing to swear, yea my heart biddeth it, nor will I forswear myself before
God. Let Achilles abide for a space, eager for battle though he be, and all ye
others abide together, until the gifts come forth from my hut, and we make
faithful oath with sacrifice. But thee thyself I thus charge and bid. Choose
thee young men, princes of the Achaian folk, and bear my gifts from my ship,
even all that we promised yesterday to Achilles, and take with thee the women.
And let Talthybios speedily make me ready a boar-swine in the midst of the wide
Achaian host, to sacrifice to Zeus and to the Sun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And to him in answer swift-footed Achilles spake: &ldquo;Most noble son of
Atreus, Agamemnon king of men, at some other time were it even better ye should
be busied thus, when haply there shall be some pause of war, and the spirit
within my breast shall be less fierce. But now they lie mangled on the
field—even they whom Hector son of Priam slew, when Zeus gave him glory—and ye
call men to their food. Verily for my part I would bid the sons of the Achaians
to fight now unfed and fasting, and with the setting sun make ready a mighty
meal, when we shall have avenged the shame. Till then down my throat at least
nor food nor drink shall go, since my comrade is dead, who in my hut is lying
mangled by the sharp spear, with his feet toward the door, and round him our
comrades mourn, wherefore in my heart to no thought of those matters, but of
slaying, and blood, and grievous moans of men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then answered him Odysseus of many counsels: &ldquo;O Achilles, Peleus&rsquo;
son, mightiest of Achaians far, better and mightier not a little art thou than
I with the spear, but in counsel I may surpass thee greatly, since I was born
first and know more things: wherefore let thy heart endure to listen to my
speech. Quickly have men surfeit of battle, of that wherein the sword streweth
most straw yet is the harvest scantiest, [i.e., in a pitched battle there is
little plunder, the hope of which might help to sustain mel&rsquo;s efforts in
storming a town] when Zeus inclineth his balance, who is disposer of the wars
of men. But it cannot be that the Achaians fast to mourn a corpse; for
exceeding many and thick fall such on every day; when then should there be rest
from toil? Nay, it behoveth to bury him who is dead, steeling our hearts, when
once we have wept him for a day; but such as are left alive from hateful war
must take thought of meat and drink, that yet more against our foes we may
fight relentlessly ever, clad in unyielding bronze. Then let none of the host
hold back awaiting other summons; this is the summons, and ill shall it be for
whoso is left behind at the Argive ships; but all together as one we will rouse
against the horse-taming Trojans the fury of war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke, and took with him the sons of noble Nestor, and Meges son of Phyleus,
and Thoas, and Meriones, and Lykomedes son of Kreiontes, and Melanippos. And
they went on their way to the hut of Agamemnon, Atreus&rsquo; son. Forthwith as
the word was spoken so was the deed done. Seven tripods they bare from the hut,
as he promised him, and twenty bright caldrons, and twelve horses, and anon
they led forth women skilled in goodly arts, seven, and the eighth was
fair-faced Briseis. Then Odysseus, having weighed ten talents of gold in all,
led the way, and with him young men of the Achaians bare the gifts. These they
set in the midst of the place of assembly, and Agamemnon rose up, and beside
that shepherd of the host stood Talthybios, whose voice was like a god&rsquo;s,
and held a boar between his hands. And the son of Atreus drawing with his hands
his knife, which ever hung beside the mighty scabbard of his sword, cut off the
first hairs from the boar, and lifting up his hands he prayed to Zeus, and all
the Argives sat silent in their places, duly hearkening to the king. And he
prayed aloud, looking up to the wide heaven: &ldquo;Be Zeus before all witness,
highest and best of the gods, and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth
take vengeance upon men, whosoever for-sweareth himself, that never have I laid
hand on the damsel Briseis, neither to lie with her nor anywise else, but she
has abode untouched within my huts. And if aught that I swear be false, may the
gods give me all sorrows manifold, that they send on him who sinneth against
them in his oath.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and cut the boar&rsquo;s throat with the pitiless knife. And the body
Taithybios whirled and threw into the great wash of the hoary sea, to be the
food of fishes; but Achilles arose up and spake in the midst of the warrior
Argives: &ldquo;Father Zeus, sore madness dealest thou verily to men. Never
could the son of Atreus have stirred the soul within my breast, nor led off the
damsel implacably against my will, had not Zeus willed that on many of the
Achaians death should come. But now go forth to your meal, that we may join
battle thereupon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus he spake and dispersed the assembly with all speed. The rest were
scattered each to his own ship, but the great-hearted Myrmidons took up the
gifts, and bare them to the ship of godlike Achilles. And they laid them in the
huts and set the women there, and gallant squires drave the horses among their
troop.
</p>

<p>
But Briseis that was like unto golden Aphrodite, when she beheld Patroklos
mangled by the keen spear, fell about him and made shrill lament, and tore with
her hands her breast and tender neck, and beautiful face. And she spake amid
her weeping, that woman like unto goddesses: &ldquo;Patroklos, dearest to my
hapless heart, alive I left thee when I left this hut, but now, O prince of the
people, I am come back to find thee dead; thus evil ever followeth evil in my
lot. My husband, unto whom my father and lady mother gave me, I beheld before
our city mangled with the keen spear, and my three brothers whom my own mother
bore, my near and dear, who all met their day of doom. But thou, when swift
Achilles slew my husband and wasted godlike Mynes&rsquo; city, wouldest ever
that I should not even weep, and saidest that thou wouldst make me godlike
Achilles&rsquo; wedded wife, and that ye would take me in your ships to Phthia
and make me a marriage feast among the Myrmidons. Therefore with all my soul I
mourn thy death, for thou wert ever kind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake she weeping, and thereon the women wailed, in semblance for
Patroklos, but each for her own woe. But round Achilles gathered the elders of
the Achaians, praying him that he would eat; but he denied them with a groan:
&ldquo;I pray you, if any kind comrade will hearken to me, bid me not sate my
heart with meat and drink, since terrible grief is come upon me. Till the sun
go down I will abide, and endure continually until then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke, and his speech made the other chiefs depart, but the two sons of
Atreus stayed, and noble Odysseus, and Nestor and Idomeneus and Phoinox,
ancient knight, soothing him in his exceeding sorrow, but he could no whit be
soothed until he had entered the mouth of bloody war. And bethinking him he
sighed very heavily and spake aloud: &ldquo;Thou too, O hapless, dearest of my
friends, thyself wouldst verily of yore set forth in out hut with ready speed a
savoury meal, what time the Achaians hasted to wage against the horse-taming
Trojans dolorous war. But now thou liest mangled, and my heart will none of
meat and drink, that stand within, for desire of thee. Nought worse than this
could I endure, not though I should hear of my father&rsquo;s death, who now I
ween in Phthia is shedding big tears for lack of a son so dear, even me that in
an alien land for sake of baleful Helen do battle with the men of Troy; nor
though it were my beloved son who is reared for me in Skyros (if still at least
is godlike Neoptolemos alive). For hitherto had my soul within me trusted that
I alone should perish far from horse-pasturing Argos, here in the Trojan land,
but that thou shouldest return to Phthia, so that thou mightest take me the
child in thy swift black ship from Skyros and show him everything—my substance
and servants, and high-roofed mighty hall. For Peleus I ween already must be
dead and gone, or else in feeble life he hath sorrow of age, and of waiting
ever for bitter news of me, till he hear that I am dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he weeping, and the elders mourned with him, bethinking them what
each had left at home. And when the son of Kronos beheld them sorrowing he
pitied them, and forthwith to Athene spake he winged words: &ldquo;My child,
thou hast then left utterly the man of thy heart. Hath Achilles then no longer
a place within thy thought? He before the steep-prowed ships sits mourning his
dear comrade; the rest are gone to their meal, but he is fasting and unfed. But
go, distil into his breast nectar and pleasant ambrosia, that no pains of
hunger come on him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he sped forward Athene who before was fain. And she, like a falcon
wide-winged and shrill-voiced, hurled herself forth from heaven through the
upper air. So while the Achaians were arming presently throughout the camp, she
in Achilles&rsquo; breast distilled nectar and pleasant ambrosia, that grievous
hunger might not assail his knees, and then herself was gone to the firm house
of her mighty father. Then the Achaians poured forth from the swift ships. As
when thick snowflakes flutter down from Zeus, chill beneath the blast of Boreas
born in the upper air, so thick from the ships streamed forth bright glittering
helms and bossy shields, strong-plaited cuirasses and ashen spears. And the
sheen thereof went up to heaven and all the earth around laughed in the flash
of bronze, and there went a sound beneath the feet of the men, and in the midst
of them noble Achilles harnessed him. His teeth gnashed together, and his eyes
blazed as it were the flame of a fire, for into his heart was intolerable
anguish entered in. Thus wroth against the men of Troy he put on the gift of
the god, which Hephaistos wrought him by his art. First on his legs he set the
fair greaves fitted with silver ankle-pieces, and next he donned the cuirass
about his breast. Then round his shoulders he slung the bronze sword
silver-studded; then lastly he took the great and strong shield, and its
brightness shone afar off as the mool&rsquo;s. Or as when over the sea there
appeareth to sailors the brightness of a burning fire, and it burneth on high
among the mountains in some lonely steading—sailors whom storm-blasts bear
unwilling over the sea, the home of fishes, afar from them they love:— so from
Achilles&rsquo; goodly well-dight shield the brightness thereof shot up toward
heaven. And he lifted the stout helmet and set it on his head, and like a star
it shone, the horse-hair crested helmet, and around it waved plumes of gold
that Hephaistos had set thick about the crest. Then noble Achilles proved him
in his armour to know whether it fitted unto him, and whether his glorious
limbs ran free; and it became to him as it were wings, and buoyed up the
shepherd of hosts.
</p>

<p>
And forth from its stand he drew his father&rsquo;s spear, heavy and great and
strong: that spear could none other of the Achaians wield, but Achilles alone
awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron gave to his father
dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors. And Automedon and
Alkimos went about to yoke the horses, and put on them fair breast-straps, and
bits within their jaws, and stretched the reins behind to the firm-built
chariot. Then Automedon took the bright lash, fitted to his hand, and sprang up
behind the horses, and after him mounted Achilles armed, effulgent in his
armour like bright Hyperion. And terribly he called upon the horses of his
sire: &ldquo;Xanthos and Balios, famed children of Podarge, in other sort take
heed to bring your charioteer safe back to the Danaan host, when we have done
with battle, and leave him not as ye left Patroklos to lie there dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the horse Xanthos of glancing feet made answer unto him from beneath the
yoke;—and he bowed with his head, and all his mane fell from the yoke-cushion
beside the yoke and touched the ground;—for the white-armed goddess Hera gave
him speech: &ldquo;Yea verily for this hour, dread Achilles, we will still bear
thee safe, yet is thy death day nigh at hand, neither shall we be cause
thereof, but a mighty god, and forceful Fate. For not through sloth or
heedlessness of ours did the men of Troy from Patrokios&rsquo; shoulders strip
his arms, but the best of the gods, whom bright-haired Leto bore, slew him in
the forefront of the battle, and to Hector gave renown. We even with the wind
of Zephyr, swiftest, they say, of all winds, well might run; nathless to thee
thyself it is appointed to be slain in fight by a god and by a man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now when he had thus spoken the Erinyes stayed his voice. And sore troubled did
fleet-footed Achilles answer him: &ldquo;Xanthos, why prophesiest thou my
death? no wise behoveth it thee. Well know I of myself that it is appointed me
to perish here, far from my father dear and mother; howbeit anywise I will not
refrain till I give the Trojans surfeit of war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and with a cry among the foremost held on his whole-hooved steeds.
