How Achilles fought with the River, and chased the men of Troy within their
gates.
</p>

<p>
But when now they came unto the ford of the fair-flowing river, even eddying
Xanthos, whom immortal Zeus begat, there sundering them he chased the one part
to the plain toward the city, even where the Achaians were flying in affright
the day before, when glorious Hector was in his fury—thither poured some in
flight, and Hera spread before them thick mist to hinder them:—but half were
pent into the deep-flowing silver eddied river, and fell therein with a mighty
noise, and the steep channel sounded, and the banks around rang loudly; for
with shouting they swam therein hither and thither whirled round the eddies.
And as when at the rush of fire locusts take wing to fly unto a river, and the
unwearying fire flameth forth on them with sudden onset, and they huddle in the
water; so before Achilles was the stream of deep-eddying Xanthos filled with
the roar and the throng of horses and men.
</p>

<p>
Then the seed of Zeus left behind him his spear upon the bank, leant against
tamarisk bushes, and leapt in, as it were a god, keeping his sword alone, and
devised grim work at heart, and smote as he turned him every way about: and
their groaning went up ghastly as they were stricken by the sword, and the
water reddened with blood. As before a dolphin of huge maw fly other fish and
fill the nooks of some fair-havened bay, in terror, for he devoureth amain
whichsoever of them he may catch; so along the channels of that dread stream
the Trojans crouched beneath the precipitous sides. And when his hands were
weary of slaughter he chose twelve young men alive out of the river, an
atonement for Patroklos, Menoitios&rsquo; son that was dead. These brought he
forth amazed like fawns, and bound behind them their hands with well-cut
thongs, which they themselves wore on their pliant doublets, and gave them to
his comrades to lead down to the hollow ships. Then again he made his onset,
athirst for slaying.
</p>

<p>
There met he a son of Dardanid Priam, in flight out of the river, Lykaon, whom
once himself he took and brought unwilling out of his father&rsquo;s orchard,
in a night assault; he was cutting with keen bronze young shoots of a wild fig
tree, to be hand-rails of a chariot; but to him an unlooked-for bane came
goodly Achilles. And at that time he sold him into well-peopled Lemnos, sending
him on ship board, and the son of Jason gave a price for him; and thence a
guest friend freed him with a great ransom, Eetion of Imbros, and sent him to
goodly Arisbe; whence flying secretly he came to his father&rsquo;s house.
Eleven days he rejoiced among his friends after he was come from Lemnos, but on
the twelfth once more God brought him into the hands of Achilles, who was to
send him to the house of Hades though nowise fain to go. Him when fleet-footed
noble Achilles saw bare of helm and shield, neither had he a spear, but had
thrown all to the ground; for he sweated grievously as he tried to flee out of
the river, and his knees were failing him for weariness: then in wrath spake
Achilles to his great heart: &ldquo;Ha! verily great marvel is this that I
behold with my eyes. Surely then will the proud Trojans whom I have slain rise
up again from beneath the murky gloom, since thus hath this man come back
escaped from his pitiless fate, though sold into goodly Lemnos, neither hath
the deep of the hoary sea stayed him, that holdeth many against their will. But
come then, of our spear&rsquo;s point shall he taste, that I may see and learn
in my mind whether likewise he shall come back even from beneath, or whether
the life-giving Earth shall hold him down, she that holdeth so even the
strong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus pondered he in his place; but the other came near amazed, fain to touch
his knees, for his soul longed exceedingly to flee from evil death and black
destruction. Then goodly Achilles lifted his long spear with intent to smite
him, but he stooped and ran under it and caught his knees; and the spear went
over his back and stood in the ground, hungering for flesh of men. Then Lykaon
besought him, with one hand holding his knees, while with the other he held the
sharp spear and loosed it not, and spake to him winged words: &ldquo;I cry thee
mercy, Achilles; have thou regard and pity for me: to thee, O fosterling of
Zeus, am I in the bonds of suppliantship. For at thy table first I tasted meal
of Demeter on the day when thou didst take me captive in the well-ordered
orchard, and didst sell me away from my father and my friends unto goodly
Lemnos, and I fetched thee the price of a hundred oxen. And now have I been
ransomed for thrice that, and this is my twelfth morn since I came to Ilios
after much pain. Now once again hath ruinous fate delivered me unto thy hands;
surely I must be hated of father Zeus, that he hath given me a second time unto
thee; and to short life my mother bare me, Laothoe, old Altes&rsquo;
daughter—Altes who ruleth among the war-loving Leleges, holding steep Pedasos
on the Satnioeis. His daughter Priam had to wife, with many others, and of her
were we two born, and thou wilt butcher both. Him among the foremost of the
foot-soldiers didst thou lay low, even godlike Polydoros, when thou smotest him
with they sharp spear: and now will it go hard with me here, for no hope have I
to escape thy hands, since God hath delivered me thereunto. Yet one thing will
I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart: slay me not, since I am not of the
same mother as Hector, who slew thy comrade the gentle and brave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake to him the noble son of Priam, beseeching him with words, but he
heard a voice implacable: &ldquo;Fond fool, proffer me no ransom, nor these
words. Until Patroklos met his fated day, then was it welcomer to my soul to
spare the men of Troy, and many I took alive and sold beyond the sea: but now
there is none shall escape death, whomsoever before Ilios God shall deliver
into my hands—yes, even among all Trojans, but chiefest among Priam&rsquo;s
sons. Ay, friend, thou too must die: why lamentest thou? Patroklos is dead, who
was better far than thou. Seest thou not also what manner of man am I for might
and goodliness? and a good man was my father, and a goddess mother bare me. Yet
over me too hang death and forceful fate. There cometh morn or eve or some
noonday when my life too some man shall take in battle, whether with spear he
smite or arrow from the string.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and the other&rsquo;s knees and heart were unstrung. He let go
Achilles&rsquo; spear, and sat with both hands outspread. But Achilles drew his
sharp sword and smote on the collar-bone beside the neck, and all the two-edged
sword sank into him, and he lay stretched prone upon the earth, and blood
flowed dark from him and soaked the earth. Him seized Achilles by the foot and
sent him down the stream, and over him exulting spake winged words:
&ldquo;There lie thou among the fishes, which shall lick off thy wound&rsquo;s
blood heedlessly, nor shall thy mother lay thee on a bed and mourn for thee,
but Skamandros shall bear thee on his eddies into the broad bosom of the sea.
Leaping along the wave shall many a fish dart up to the dark ripple to eat of
the white flesh of Lykaon. So perish all, until we reach the citadel of sacred
Ilios, ye flying and I behind destroying. Nor even the River, fair-flowing,
silver-eddied, shall avail you, to whom long time forsooth ye sacrifice many
bulls, and among his eddies throw whole-hooved horses down alive. For all this
yet shall ye die the death, until ye pay all for Patroklos&rsquo; slaying and
the slaughter of Achaians whom at the swift ships ye slew while I tarried
afar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, but the River waxed ever more wroth in his heart, and sought in
his soul how he should stay goodly Achilles from his work, and ward destruction
from the Trojans. Meanwhile the son of Peleus with his far-shadowing spear
leapt, fain to slay him, upon Asteropaios son of Pelegon, whom wide-flowing
Axios begat of Periboia eldest of the daughters of Akessamenos. Upon him set
Achilles, and Asteropaios stood against him from the river, holding two spears;
for Xanthos put courage into his heart, being angered for the slaughtered
youths whom Achilles was slaughtering along the stream and had no pity on them.
Then when the twain were come nigh in onset on each other, unto him first spake
fleet-footed noble Achilles: &ldquo;Who and whence art thou of men, that darest
to come against me? Ill-fated are they whose children match them with my
might.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And to him, made answer Pelegol&rsquo;s noble son: &ldquo;High-hearted son of
Peleus, why askest thou my lineage? I come from deep-soiled Paionia, a land far
off, leading Paionian men with their long spears, and this now is the eleventh
morn since I am come to Ilios. My lineage is of wide-flowing Axios, who begat
Pelegon famous with the spear, and he, men say, was my father. Now fight we,
noble Achilles!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he in defiance, and goodly Achilles lifted the Pelian ash: but the
warrior Asteropaios hurled with both spears together, for he could use both
hands alike, and with the one spear smote the shield, but pierced it not right
through, for the gold stayed it, the gift of a god; and with the other he
grazed the elbow of Achilles&rsquo; right arm, and there leapt forth dark
blood, but the point beyond him fixed itself in the earth, eager to batten on
flesh. Then in his turn Achilles hurled on Asteropaios his straight-flying ash,
fain to have slain him, but missed the man and struck the high bank, and
quivering half its length in the bank he left the ashen spear. Then the son of
Peleus drew his sharp sword from his thigh and leapt fiercely at him, and he
availed not to draw with his stout hand Achilles&rsquo; ashen shaft from the
steep bank. Thrice shook he it striving to draw it forth, and thrice gave up
the strain, but the fourth time he was fain to bend and break the ashen spear
of the seed of Aiakos, but ere that Achilles closing on him reft him of life
with his sword. For in the belly he smote him beside the navel, and all his
bowels gushed out to the earth, and darkness covered his eyes as he lay
gasping. Then Achilles trampling on his breast stripped off his armour and
spake exultingly: &ldquo;Lie there! It is hard to strive against children of
Kronos&rsquo; mighty son, even though one be sprung from a River-god. Thou
truly declarest thyself the seed of a wide-flowing River, but I avow me of the
linkage of great Zeus. My sire is a man ruling many Myrmidons, Peleus the son
of Aiakos, and Aiakos was begotten of Zeus. As Zeus is mightier than
seaward-murmuring rivers, so is the seed of Zeus made mightier than the seed of
a river. Nay, there is hard beside thee a great river, if he may anywise avail;
but against Zeus the son of Kronos it is not possible to fight. For him not
even king Acheloios is match, nor yet the great strength of deep-flowing Ocean,
from whom all rivers flow and every sea, and all springs and deep wells: yea,
even he hath fear of the lightning of great Zeus and his dread thunder, when it
pealeth out of heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and from the steep bank drew his bronze spear, and left there
Asteropaios whom he had slain, lying in the sands, and the dark water flooded
him. Around him eels and fishes swarmed, tearing and gnawing the fat about his
kidneys. But Achilles went on after the charioted Paiones who still along the
eddying river huddled in fear, when they saw their best man in the stress of
battle slain violently by the hands and the sword of the son of Peleus. There
slew he Thersilochos and Mydon and Astypylos and Mnesos and Thrasios and Ainios
and Ophelestes; and more yet of the Paiones would swift Achilles have slain,
had not the deep-eddying River called unto him in wrath, in semblance of a man,
and from an eddy&rsquo;s depth sent forth a voice: &ldquo;O Achilles, thy might
and thy evil work are beyond the measure of men; for gods themselves are ever
helping thee. If indeed the son of Kronos hath delivered thee all the Trojans
to destroy, at least drive them forth from me and do thy grim deeds on the
plain, for filled with dead men is my pleasant bed, nor can I pour my stream to
the great sea, being choked with dead, and thou slayest ruthlessly. Come then,
let be; I am astonished, O captain of hosts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And to him answered Achilles fleet of foot: &ldquo;So be it, heaven-sprung
Skamandros, even as thou biddest. But the proud Trojans I will not cease from
slaying until I have driven them into their city, and have made trial with
Hector face to face whether he is to vanquish me or I him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying, he set upon the Trojans, like a god. Then unto Apollo spake the
deep-eddying River: &ldquo;Out on it, lord of the silver bow, child of Zeus,
thou hast not kept the ordinance of Kronos&rsquo; son, who charged thee
straitly to stand by the Trojans and to help them, until eve come with light
late-setting, and darken the deep-soiled earth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and spear-famed Achilles sprang from the bank and leapt into his
midst; but he rushed on him in a furious wave, and stirred up all his streams
in tumult, and swept down the many dead who lay thick in him, slain by
Achilles; these out to land he cast with bellowing like a bull, and saved the
living under his fair streams, hiding them within eddies deep and wide. But
terribly around Achilles arose his tumultuous wave, and the stream smote
violently against his shield, nor availed he to stand firm upon his feet. Then
he grasped a tall fair-grown elm, and it fell uprooted and tore away all the
bank, and reached over the fair river bed with its thick shoots, and stemmed
the River himself, falling all within him: and Achilles, struggling out of the
eddy, made haste to fly over the plain with his swift feet, for he was afraid.
But the great god ceased not, but arose upon him with darkness on his crest,
that he might stay noble Achilles from slaughter, and ward destruction from the
men of Troy. And the son of Peleus rushed away a spear&rsquo;s throw, with the
swoop of a black eagle, the mighty hunter, strongest at once and swiftest of
winged birds. Like him he sped, and on his breast the bronze rang terribly as
he fled from beneath the onset, and behind him the River rushed on with a
mighty roar. As when a field-waterer from a dark spring leadeth water along a
bed through crops and garden grounds, a mattock in his hands, casting forth
hindrances from the ditch, and as it floweth all pebbles are swept down, and
swiftly gliding it murmureth down a sloping place, and outrunneth him that is
its guide:—thus ever the river wave caught up Achilles for all his speed; for
gods are mightier than men. For whensoever fleet-footed noble Achilles
struggled to stand against it, and know whether all immortals be upon him who
inhabit spacious heaven, then would a great wave of the heaven-sprung River
beat upon his shoulders from above, and he sprang upward with his feet, sore
vexed at heart; and the River was wearying his knees with violent rush beneath,
devouring the earth from under his feet. Then the son of Peleus cried aloud,
looking up to the broad heaven: &ldquo;Zeus, Father, how doth none of the gods
take it on him in pity to save me from the River! after that let come to me
what may. None other of the inhabitants of Heaven is chargeable so much, but
only my dear mother, who beguiled me with false words, saying that under the
wall of the mail-clad men of Troy I must die by the swift arrows of Apollo.
Would that Hector had slain me, the best of men bred here: then brave had been
the slayer, and a brave man had he slain. But now by a sorry death am I doomed
to die, pent in this mighty river, like a swineherd boy whom a torrent sweepeth
down as he essayeth to cross it in a storm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and quickly Poseidon and Athene came near and stood beside him,
in the likeness of men, and taking his hands in theirs pledged him in words.
And the first that spake was Poseidon, Shaker of the earth: &ldquo;Son of
Peleus, tremble not, neither be afraid; such helpers of thee are we from the
gods, approved of Zeus, even Pallas Athene and I, for to be vanquished of a
river is not appointed thee, but he will soon give back, and thou wilt thyself
perceive it: but we will give thee wise counsel, if thou wilt obey it; hold not
thy hand from hazardous battle until within Ilios&rsquo; famous walls thou have
pent the Trojan host, even all that flee before thee. But do thou, when thou
hast taken the life of Hector, go back unto the ships; this glory we give unto
thee to win.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They having thus spoken departed to the immortals, but he toward the plain—for
the bidding of gods was strong upon him—went onward; and all the plain was
filled with water-flood, and many beautiful arms and corpses of slain youths
were drifting there. So upward sprang his knees as he rushed against the stream
right on, nor stayed him the wide-flowing River, for Athene put great strength
in him. Neither did Skamandros slacken his fierceness, but yet more raged
against the son of Peleus, and he curled crestwise the billow of his stream,
lifting himself on high, and on Simoeis he called with a shout: &ldquo;Dear
brother, the strength of this man let us both join to stay, since quickly he
will lay waste the great city of king Priam, and the Trojans abide not in the
battle. Help me with speed, and fill thy streams with water from thy springs,
and urge on all thy torrents, and raise up a great wave, and stir huge roaring
of tree-stumps and stones, that we may stay the fierce man who now is lording
it, and deeming himself match for gods. For neither, I ween, will strength
avail him nor comeliness anywise, nor that armour beautiful, which deep beneath
the flood shall be o&rsquo;erlaid with slime, and himself I will wrap him in my
sands and pour round him countless shingle without stint, nor shall the
Achaians know where to gather his bones, so vast a shroud of silt will I heap
over them. Where he dieth there shall be his tomb, neither shall he have need
of any barrow to be raised, when the Achaians make his funeral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and rushed in tumult on Achilles, raging from on high, thundering with
foam and blood and bodies of dead men. Then did a dark wave of the
heaven-sprung River stand towering up and overwhelm the son of Peleus. But Hera
cried aloud in terror of Achilles, lest the great deep-eddying River sweep him
away, and straightway she called to Hephaistos, her dear son: &ldquo;Rise, lame
god, O my son; it was against thee we thought that eddying Xanthos was matched
in fight. Help with all speed, put forth large blast of flame. Then will I go
to raise a strong storm out of the sea of the west wind and the white south
which shall utterly consume the dead Trojans and their armour, blowing the
angry flame. Thou along Xanthos&rsquo; banks burn up his trees and wrap himself
in fire, nor let him anywise turn thee back by soft words or by threat, nor
stay thy rage—only when I cry to thee with my voice, then hold the unwearying
fire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake she, and Hephaistos made ready fierce-blazing fire. First on the
plain fire blazed, and burnt the many dead who lay there thick, slain by
Achilles; and all the plain was parched and the bright water stayed. And as
when in late summer the north wind swiftly parcheth a new watered orchard, and
he that tilleth it is glad, thus was the whole plain parched, and Hephaistos
consumed the dead; then against the river he turned his gleaming flame. Elms
burnt and willow trees and tamarisks, and lotos burnt and rush and galingale
which round the fair streams of the river grew in multitude. And the eels and
fishes beneath the eddies were afflicted, which through the fair streams
tumbled this way and that, in anguish at the blast of crafty Hephaistos. And
the strong River burned, and spake and called to him by name:
&ldquo;Hephaistos, there is no god can match with thee, nor will I fight thee
thus ablaze with fire. Cease strife, yea, let noble Achilles drive the Trojans
forthwith out of their city; what have I to do with strife and succour?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, burnt with fire, for his fair streams were bubbling. And as a
cauldron boileth within, beset with much fire, melting the lard of some fatted
hog spurting up on all sides, and logs of firewood lie thereunder,—so burned
his fair streams in the fire, and the water boiled. He had no mind to flow, but
refrained him, for the breath of cunning Hephaistos violently afflicted him.
Then unto Hera, earnestly beseeching her,&rsquo; he spake winged words:
&ldquo;Hera, wherefore hath thy son assailed my stream to vex it above others?
I am less chargeable than all the rest that are helpers of the Trojans. But lo,
I will give over, if thou wilt, and let thy son give over too. And I further
will swear even this, that never will I ward the day of evil from the Trojans,
not even when all Troy is burning in the blaze of hungry fire, and the warlike
sons of Achaians are the burners thereof.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then when the white-armed goddess Hera heard his speech, straightway she spake
unto Hephaistos her dear son: &ldquo;Hephaistos, hold, famed son; it befitteth
not thus for mortals&rsquo; sake to do violence to an immortal god.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus said she and Hephaistos quenched the fierce-blazing fire, and the wave
once more rolled down the fair river-bed.
</p>

<p>
So when the rage of Xanthos was overcome, both ceased, for Hera stayed them,
though in wrath. But among the other gods fell grievous bitter strife, and
their hearts were carried diverse in their breasts. And they clashed together
with a great noise, and the wide earth groaned, and the clarion of great Heaven
rang around. Zeus heard as he sate upon Olympus, and his heart within him
laughed pleasantly when he beheld that strife of gods. Then no longer stood
they asunder, for Ares piercer of shields began the battle and first made for
Athene with his bronze spear, and spake a taunting word: &ldquo;Wherefore, O
dogfly, dost thou match gods with gods in strife, with stormy daring, as thy
great spirit moveth thee? Rememberest thou not how thou movedst Diomedes
Tydeus&rsquo; son to wound me, and thyself didst take a visible spear and
thrust it straight at me and pierce through my fair skin? Therefore deem I now
that thou shalt pay me for all that thou hast done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he smote on the dread tasselled aegis that not even the lightning
of Zeus can overcome—thereon smote bloodstained Ares with his long spear. But
she, giving back, grasped with stout hand a stone that lay upon the plain,
black, rugged, huge, which men of old time set to be the landmark of a field;
this hurled she, and smote impetuous Ares on the neck, and unstrung his limbs.
Seven roods he covered in his fall, and soiled his hair with dust, and his
armour rang upon him. And Pallas Athene laughed, and spake to him winged words
exultingly: &ldquo;Fool, not even yet hast thou learnt how far better than thou
I claim to be, that thus thou matchest thy might with mine. Thus shalt thou
satisfy thy mother&rsquo;s curses, who deviseth mischief against thee in her
wrath, for that thou hast left the Achaians and givest the proud Trojal&rsquo;s
aid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus having said she turned from him her shining eyes. Him did Aphrodite
daughter of Zeus take by the hand and lead away, groaning continually, for
scarce gathered he his spirit back to him. But when the white-armed goddess
Hera was aware of them, straightway she spake unto Athene winged words:
&ldquo;Out on it, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, maiden invincible, lo there the
dogfly is leading Ares destroyer of men out of the fray of battle down the
throng—nay then, pursue her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She said, and Athene sped after her with heart exultant, and made at her and
smote her with stout hand upon the breast, and straightway her knees and heart
were unstrung. So they twain lay on the bounteous earth, and she spake winged
words exultingly: &ldquo;Such let all be who give the Trojans aid when they
fight against the mailed Argives. Be they even so bold and brave as Aphrodite
when she came to succour Ares and defied my might. Then should we long ago have
ceased from war, having laid waste the stablished citadel of Ilios.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
[She said, and the white-armed goddess Hera smiled.] Then to Apollo spake the
earth-shaking lord: &ldquo;Phoebus, why stand we apart? It befitteth not after
the rest have begun: that were the more shameful if without fighting we should
go to Olympus to the bronze-thresholded house of Zeus. Begin, for thou art
younger; it were not meet for me, since I was born first and know more. Fond
god, how foolish is thy heart! Thou rememberest not all the ills we twain alone
of gods endured at Ilios, when by ordinance of Zeus we came to proud Laomedon
and served him through a year for promised recompense, and he laid on us his
commands. I round their city built the Trojans a wall, wide and most fair, that
the city might be unstormed, and thou Phoebus, didst herd shambling
crook-horned kine among the spurs of woody many-folded Ida. But when the joyous
seasons were accomplishing the term of hire, then redoubtable Laomedon robbed
us of all hire, and sent us off with threats. He threatened that he would bind
together our feet and hands and sell us into far-off isles, and the ears of
both of us he vowed to shear off with the sword. So we went home with angry
hearts, wroth for the hire he promised and gave us not. To his folk not thou
showest favour, nor essayest with us how the proud Trojans may be brought low
and perish miserably with their children and noble wives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then to him answered King Apollo the Far-darter: &ldquo;Shaker of the earth, of
no sound mind wouldst thou repute me if I should fight against thee for the
sake of pitiful mortals, who like unto leaves now live in glowing life,
consuming the fruit of the earth, and now again pine into death. Let us with
all speed cease from combat, and let them do battle by themselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he turned away, for he felt shame to deal in blows with his
father&rsquo;s brother. But his sister upbraided him sore, the queen of wild
beasts, huntress Artemis, and spake a taunting word: &ldquo;So then thou
fleest, Far-darter, hast quite yielded to Poseidon the victory, and given him
glory for naught! Fond god, why bearest thou an ineffectual bow in vain? Let me
not hear thee again in the halls of our sire boast as before among the immortal
gods thou wouldst stand up to fight against Poseidon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake she, but far-darting Apollo answered her not. But angrily the noble
spouse of Zeus [upbraided the Archer Queen with taunting words:] &ldquo;How now
art thou fain, bold vixen, to set thyself against me? Hard were it for thee to
match my might, bow-bearer though thou art, since against women Zeus made thee
a lion, and giveth thee to slay whomso of them thou wilt. Truly it is better on
the mountains to slay wild beasts and deer than to fight amain with mightier
than thou. But if thou wilt, try war, that thou mayest know well how far
stronger am I, since thou matchest thy might with mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She said, and with her left hand caught both the other&rsquo;s hands by the
wrist, and with her right took the bow from off her shoulders, and therewith,
smiling, beat her on the ears as she turned this way and that; and the swift
arrows fell out of her quiver. And weeping from before her the goddess fled
like a dove that from before a falcon flieth to a hollow rock, a cleft—for she
was not fated to be caught;—thus Artemis fled weeping, and left her bow and
arrows where they lay. Then to Leto spake the Guide, the slayer of Argus:
&ldquo;Leto, with thee will I no wise fight; a grievous thing it is to come to
blows with wives of cloud-gathering Zeus; but boast to thy heart&rsquo;s
content among the immortal gods that thou didst vanquish me by might and
main.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus said he, and Leto gathered up the curved bow and arrows fallen hither and
thither amid the whirl of dust: so taking her daughter&rsquo;s bow she went
back. And the maiden came to Olympus, to the bronze-thresholded house of Zeus,
and weeping set herself on her father&rsquo;s knee, while round her her divine
vesture quivered: and her father, Kronos&rsquo; son, took her to him and asked
of her, laughing gently: &ldquo;Who of the inhabitants of heaven, dear child,
hath dealt with thee thus [hastily, as though thou hadst been doing some wrong
thing openly]?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And to him in answer spake the fair-crowned queen of the echoing chase:
&ldquo;It was thy wife that buffeted me, father, the white-armed Hera, from
whom are strife and contention come upon the immortals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus talked they unto one another. Then Phoebus Apollo entered into sacred
Ilios, for he was troubled for the wall of the well-builded city, lest the
Danaans waste it before its hour upon that day. But the other ever-living gods
went to Olympus, some angry and some greatly triumphing, and sat down beside
Zeus who hideth himself in dark clouds.
</p>

<p>
Now Achilles was still slaying the Trojans, both themselves and their
whole-hooved horses. And as when a smoke goeth up to the broad heaven, when a
city burneth, kindled by the wrath of gods, and causeth toil to all, and griefs
to many, thus caused Achilles toil and griefs to the Trojans. And the old man
Priam stood on the sacred tower, and was aware of dread Achilles, how before
him the Trojans thronged in rout, nor was any succour found of them. Then with
a cry he went down from the tower, to rouse the gallant warders along the
walls: &ldquo;Hold open the gates in your hands until the folk come to the city
in their rout, for closely is Achilles chasing them—now trow I there will be
deadly deeds. And when they are gathered within the wall and are taking breath,
then again shut back the gate-wings firmly builded; for I fear lest that
murderous man spring in within the wall.&rdquo;
</p>

Thus spake he, and they opened the gates and thrust back the bolts; and the
gates flung back gave safety. Then Apollo leapt forth to the front that he
might ward destruction from the Trojans. They straight for the city and the
high wall were fleeing, parched with thirst and dust-grimed from the plain, and
Achilles chased them vehemently with his spear, for strong frenzy possessed his
heart continually, and he thirsted to win him renown. Then would the sons of
the Achaians have taken high-gated Troy, had not Phoebus Apollo aroused goodly
Agenor, Antenor&rsquo;s son, a princely man and strong. In his heart he put
good courage, and himself stood by his side that he might ward off the grievous
visitations of death, leaning against the oak, and he was shrouded in thick
mist. So when Agenor was aware of Achilles waster of cities, he halted, and his
heart much wavered as he stood; and in trouble he spake to his great heart:
&ldquo;Ay me, if I flee before mighty Achilles, there where the rest are driven
terror-struck, nathless will he overtake me and slaughter me as a coward. Or
what if I leave these to be driven before Achilles the son of Peleus, and flee
upon my feet from the wall by another way to the Ileian plain, until I come to
the spurs of Ida, and hide me in the underwood? So then at evening, having
bathed in the river and refreshed me of sweat, I might return to Ilios. Nay,
why doth my heart debate thus within me? Lest he might be aware of me as I get
me from the city for the plain, and speeding after overtake me with swift feet;
then will it no more be possible to avoid the visitation of death, for he is
exceeding mighty above all mankind. What then if in front of the city I go
forth to meet him? Surely his flesh too is penetrable by sharp bronze, and
there is but one life within, and men say he is mortal, howbeit Zeus the son of
Kronos giveth him renown.&rdquo;

<p>
Thus saying, he gathered himself to await Achilles, and within him his stout
heart was set to strive and fight. As a leopardess goeth forth from a deep
thicket to affront a huntsman, nor is afraid at heart, nor fleeth when she
heareth the bay of hounds; for albeit the man first smite her with thrust or
throw, yet even pierced through with the spear she ceaseth not from her courage
until she either grapple or be slain, so noble Antenor&rsquo;s son, goodly
Agenor, refused to flee till he should put Achilles to the proof, but held
before him the circle of his shield, and aimed at him with his spear, and cried
aloud: &ldquo;Doubtless thou hopest in thy heart, noble Achilles, on this day
to sack the city of the proud men of Troy. Fond man, there shall many woful
things yet be wrought before it, for within it we are many men and staunch, who
in front of our parents dear and wives and sons keep Ilios safe; but thou shalt
here meet death, albeit so redoubtable and bold a man of war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and hurled his sharp spear with weighty hand, and smote him on the leg
beneath the knee, nor missed his mark, and the greave of new-wrought tin rang
terribly on him; but the bronze bounded back from him it smote, nor pierced
him, for the god&rsquo;s gift drave it back. Then the son of Peleus in his turn
made at godlike Agenor, but Apollo suffered him not to win renown, but caught
away Agenor, and shrouded him in thick mist, and sent him in peace to be gone
out of the war. Then by wile kept the son of Peleus away from the folk, for in
complete semblance of Agenor himself he stood before the feet of Achilles, who
hasted to run upon him and chase him. And while he chased him over the
wheat-bearing plain, edging him toward the deep-eddying river Skamandros, as he
ran but a little in front of him (for by wile Apollo beguiled him that he kept
ever hoping to overtake him in the race), meantime the other Trojans in common
rout came gladly unto their fastness, and the city was filled with the throng
of them. Neither had they heart to await one another outside the city and wall,
and to know who might have escaped and who had perished in the fight, but
impetuously they poured into the city, whomsoever of them his feet and knees
might save.
