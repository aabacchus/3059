<p class="letter">
Of the battle around the body of Patroklos.
</p>

<p>
But Atreus&rsquo; son, Menelaos dear to Ares, was not unaware of the slaying of
Patroklos by the Trojans in the fray. He went up through the front of the fight
harnessed in flashing bronze, and strode over the body as above a first-born
calf standeth lowing its mother. Thus above Patroklos strode fair-haired
Menelaos, and before him held his spear and the circle of his shield, eager to
slay whoever should encounter him. Then was Panthoos&rsquo; son of the stout
ashen spear not heedless of noble Patroklos as he lay, and he smote on the
circle of the shield of Menelaos, but the bronze spear brake it not, but the
point was bent back in the stubborn shield. And Menelaos Atreus&rsquo; son in
his turn made at him with his bronze spear, having prayed unto father Zeus, and
as he gave back pierced the nether part of his throat, and threw his weight
into the stroke, following his heavy hand; and sheer through the tender neck
went the point of the spear. And he fell with a crash, and his armour rang upon
him. In blood was his hair drenched that was like unto the hair of the Graces,
and his tresses closely knit with bands of silver and gold.
</p>

<p>
Then easily would the son of Atreus have borne off the noble spoils of
Panthoos&rsquo; son, had not Phoebus Apollo grudged it to him, and aroused
against him Hector peer of swift Ares, putting on the semblance of a man, of
Mentes chief of the Kikones. And he spake aloud to him winged words:
&ldquo;Hector, now art thou hasting after things unattainable, even the horses
of wise Aiakides; for hard are they to be tamed or driven by mortal man, save
only Achilles whom an immortal mother bare. Meanwhile hath warlike Menelaos
Atreus&rsquo; son stridden over Patroklos and slain the best of the Trojans
there, even Panthoos&rsquo; son Euphorbos, and hath stayed him in his impetuous
might.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying the god went back into the strife of men, but dire grief darkened
Hectors inmost soul, and then he gazed searchingly along the lines, and
straightway was aware of the one man stripping off the noble arms, and the
other lying on the earth; and blood was flowing about the gaping wound. Then he
went through the front of the fight harnessed in flashing bronze, crying a
shrill cry, like unto Hephaistos&rsquo; flame unquenchable. Not deaf to his
shrill cry was Atreus&rsquo; son, and sore troubled he spake to his great
heart: &ldquo;Ay me, if I shall leave behind me these goodly arms, and
Patroklos who here lieth for my vengeance&rsquo; sake, I fear lest some Danaan
beholding it be wroth against me. But if for honour&rsquo;s sake I do battle
alone with Hector and the Trojans, I fear lest they come about me many against
one; for all the Trojans is bright-helmed Hector leading hither. But if I might
somewhere find Aias of the loud war-cry, then both together would we go and be
mindful of battle even were it against the power of heaven, if haply we might
save his dead for Achilles Peleus&rsquo; son: that were best among these
ills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While thus he communed with his mind and heart, therewithal the Trojan ranks
came onward, and Hector at their head. Then Menelaos gave backward, and left
the dead man, turning himself ever about like a deep-waned lion which men and
dogs chase from a fold with spears and cries; and his strong heart within him
groweth chill, and loth goeth he from the steading; so from Patroklos went
fair-haired Menelaos, and turned and stood, when he came to the host of his
comrades, searching for mighty Aias Telamol&rsquo;s son. Him very speedily he
espied on the left of the whole battle, cheering his comrades and rousing them
to fight, for great terror had Phoebus Apollo sent on them; and he hasted him
to run, and straightway stood by him and said: &ldquo;This way, beloved Aias;
let us bestir us for the dead Patroklos, if haply his naked corpse at least we
may carry to Achilles, though his armour is held by Hector of the glancing
helm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and aroused the heart of wise Aias. And he went up through the
front of the fight, and with him fair-haired Menelaos. Now Hector, when he had
stripped from Patroklos his noble armour, was dragging him thence that he might
cut off the head from the shoulders with the keen bronze and carry his body to
give to the dogs of Troy. But Aias came anigh, and the shield that he bare was
as a tower; then Hector gave back into the company of his comrades, and sprang
into his chariot; and the goodly armour he gave to the Trojans to carry to the
city, to be great glory unto him. But Aias spread his broad shield over the son
of Menoitios and stood as it were a lion before his whelps when huntsmen in a
forest encounter him as he leadeth his young. And by his side stood
Atreus&rsquo; son, Menelaos dear to Ares, nursing great sorrow in his breast.
</p>

<p>
Then Hector called on the Trojans with a mighty shout; &ldquo;Trojans and
Lykians and Dardanians that fight hand to hand, be men, my friends, and bethink
you of impetuous valour, until I do on me the goodly arms of noble Achilles
that I stripped from brave Patroklos when I slew him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus having spoken went Hector of the glancing helm forth out of the strife of
war, and ran and speedily with fleet feet following overtook his comrades, not
yet far off, who were bearing to the city Peleides&rsquo; glorious arms. And
standing apart from the dolorous battle he changed his armour; his own he gave
the warlike Trojans to carry to sacred Ilios, and he put on the divine arms of
Achilles, Peleus&rsquo; son.
</p>

<p>
But when Zeus that gathereth the clouds beheld from afar off Hector arming him
in the armour of Peleus&rsquo; godlike son, he shook his head and spake thus
unto his soul: &ldquo;Ah, hapless man, no thought is in thy heart of death that
yet draweth nigh unto thee; thou doest on thee the divine armour of a peerless
man before whom the rest have terror. His comrade, gentle and brave, thou hast
slain, and unmeetly hast stripped the armour from his head and shoulders; yet
now for a while at least I will give into thy hands great might, in recompense
for this, even that nowise shalt thou come home out of the battle, for
Andromache to receive from thee Peleides&rsquo; glorious arms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake the son of Kronos, and bowed his dark brows therewithal.
</p>

<p>
But the armour fitted itself unto Hectors body, and Ares the dread war-god
entered into him, and his limbs were filled within with valour and strength.
Then he sped among the noble allies with a mighty cry, and in the flashing of
his armour he seemed to all of them like unto Peleus&rsquo; great-hearted son.
And he came to each and encouraged him with his words—Mesthles and Glaukos and
Medon and Thersilochos and Asteropaios and Deisenor and Hippothoos and Phorkys
and Chromios and the augur Ennomos—these encouraged he and spake to them winged
words: &ldquo;Listen, ye countless tribes of allies that dwell round about. It
was not for mere numbers that I sought or longed when I gathered each of you
from your cities, but that ye might zealously guard the Trojans&rsquo; wives
and infant little ones from the war-loving Achaians. For this end am I wearying
my people by taking gifts and food from them, and nursing thereby the courage
of each of you. Now therefore let all turn straight against the foe and live or
die, for such is the dalliance of war. And whoso shall drag Patroklos, dead
though he be, among the horse-taming men of Troy, and make Aias yield, to him
will I award half the spoils and keep half myself; so shall his glory be great
as mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and they against the Danaans charged with all their weight,
levelling their spears, and their hearts were high of hope to drag the corpse
from under Aias, Telamol&rsquo;s son. Fond men! from full many reft he life
over that corpse. And then spake Aias to Menelaos of the loud war-cry:
&ldquo;Dear Menelaos, fosterling of Zeus, no longer count I that we two of
ourselves shall return home out of the war. Nor have I so much dread for the
corpse of Patroklos, that shall soon glut the dogs and birds of the men of
Troy, as for thy head and mine lest some evil fall thereon, for all is shrouded
by a storm-cloud of war, even by Hector, and sheer doom stareth in our face.
But come, call thou to the best men of the Danaans, if haply any hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and Menelaos of the loud war-cry disregarded him not, but
shouted unto the Danaans, crying a far-heard cry: &ldquo;O friends, ye leaders
and counsellors of the Argives, who by the side of the sons of Atreus,
Agamemnon and Menelaos, drink at the common cost and are all commanders of the
host, on whom wait glory and honour from Zeus, hard is it for me to distinguish
each chief amid the press—such blaze is there of the strife of war. But let
each go forward of himself and be wroth at heart that Patroklos should become a
sport among the dogs of Troy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and Oileus&rsquo; son fleet Aias heard him clearly, and was
first to run along the mellay to meet him, and after him Idomeneus, and
Idomeneus&rsquo; brother-in-arms, Meriones, peer of the man-slaying war-god.
And who shall of his own thought tell the names of the rest, even of all that
after these aroused the battle of the Achaians?
</p>

<p>
Now the Trojans charged forward in close array, and Hector led them. And as
when at the mouth of some heaven-born river a mighty wave roareth against the
stream, and arouseth the high cliffs&rsquo; echo as the salt sea belloweth on
the beach, so loud was the cry wherewith the Trojans came. But the Achaians
stood firm around Menoitios&rsquo; son with one soul all, walled in with
shields of bronze. And over their bright helmets the son of Kronos shed thick
darkness, for in the former time was Menoitios&rsquo; son not unloved of him,
while he was yet alive and squire of Aiakides. So was Zeus loth that he should
become a prey of the dogs of his enemies at Troy, and stirred his comrades to
do battle for him.
</p>

<p>
Now first the Trojans thrust back the glancing-eyed Achaians, who shrank before
them and left the dead, yet the proud Trojans slew not any of them with spears,
though they were fain, but set to hale the corpse. But little while would the
Achaians hold back therefrom, for very swiftly Aias rallied them, Aias the
first in presence and in deeds of all the Danaans after the noble son of
Peleus. Right through the fighters in the forefront rushed he like a wild boar
in his might that in the mountains when he turneth at bay scattereth lightly
dogs and lusty young men through the glades. Thus did proud Telamol&rsquo;s son
the glorious Aias press on the Trojan battalions and lightly scatter them, as
they had bestrode Patroklos and were full fain to drag him to their city and
win renown.
</p>

<p>
Then would the Trojans in their turn in their weakness overcome have been
driven back into Ilios by the Achaians dear to Ares, and the Argives would have
won glory even against the appointment of Zeus by their power and might. But
Apollo himself aroused Aineias, putting on the semblance of Periphas the
herald, the son of Epytos, who grew old with his old father in his heraldship,
of friendly thought toward Aineias. In his similitude spake Apollo, son of
Zeus: &ldquo;Aineias, how could ye ever guard high Ilios if it were against the
will of God? Other men have I seen that trust in their own might and power and
valour, and in their host, even though they have scant folk to lead. But here,
albeit Zeus is fainer far to give victory to us than to the Danaans, yet ye are
dismayed exceedingly and fight not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and Aineias knew far-darting Apollo when he looked upon his
face, and spake unto Hector, shouting loud &ldquo;Hector and ye other leaders
of the Trojans and their allies, shame were this if in our weakness overcome we
were driven back into Ilios by the Achaians dear to Ares. Nay, thus saith a
god, who standeth by my side: Zeus, highest Orderer, is our helper in this
fight. Therefore let us go right onward against the Danaans. Not easily at
least let them take the dead Patroklos to the ships.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and leapt forth far before the fighters in the front. And the
Trojans rallied and stood up against the Achaians. Thus strove they as it had
been fire, nor wouldst thou have thought there was still sun or moon, for over
all the battle where the chiefs stood around the slain son of Menoitios they
were shrouded in darkness, while the other Trojans and well-greaved Achaians
fought at ease in the clear air, and piercing sunlight was spread over them,
and on all the earth and hills there was no cloud seen; and they ceased
fighting now sad again, avoiding each other&rsquo;s dolorous darts and standing
far apart. But they who were in the midst endured affliction of the darkness
and the battle, and all the best men of them were wearied by the pitiless
weight of their bronze arms.
</p>

<p>
Thus all day long waxed the mighty fray of their sore strife; and unabatingly
ever with the sweat of toil were the knees and legs and feet of each man and
arms anal eyes bedewed as the two hosts did battle around the brave squire of
fleet Aiakides. And as when a man giveth the hide of a great bull to his folk
to stretch, all soaked in fat, and they take and stretch it standing in a
circle, and straightway the moisture thereof departeth and the fat entereth in
under the haling of many hands, and it is all stretched throughout,—thus they
on both sides haled the dead man this way and that in narrow space, for their
hearts were high of hope, the Trojans that they should drag him to Ilios and
the Achaians to the hollow ships; and around him the fray waxed wild, nor might
Ares rouser of hosts nor Athene despise the sight thereof, albeit their anger
were exceeding great.
</p>

<p>
Such was the grievous travail of men and horses over Patroklos that Zeus on
that day wrought. But not as yet knew noble Achilles aught of Patroklos&rsquo;
death, for far away from the swift ships they were fighting beneath the wall of
the men of Troy. Therefore never deemed he in his heart that he was dead, but
that he should come back alive, after that he had touched the gates; for
neither that other thought had he anywise, that Patroklos should sack the
stronghold without his aid.
</p>

<p>
Now the rest continually around the dead man with their keen spears made onset
relentlessly and slew each the other. And thus would one speak among the
mail-clad Achaians: &ldquo;Friends, it were verily not glorious for us to go
back to the hollow ships; rather let the black earth yawn for us all beneath
our feet. Far better were that straightway for us if we suffer the horse-taming
Trojans to hale this man to their city and win renown.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And thus on the other side would one of the great-hearted Trojans say:
&ldquo;Friends, though it were our fate that all together we be slain beside
this man, let none yet give backward from the fray.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus would one speak, and rouse the spirit of each. So they fought on, and the
iron din went up through the high desert air unto the brazen heaven. But the
horses of Aiakides that were apart from the battle were weeping, since first
they were aware that their charioteer was fallen in the dust beneath the hand
of man-slaying Hector. Verily Automedon, Diores&rsquo; valiant son, plied them
oft with blows of the swift lash, and oft with gentle words he spake to them
and oft with chiding, yet would they neither go back to the ships at the broad
Hellespont nor yet to the battle after the Achaians, but as a pillar abideth
firm that standeth on the tomb of a man or woman dead, so abode they immovably
with the beautiful chariot, abasing their heads unto the earth. And hot tears
flowed from their eyes to the ground as they mourned in sorrow for their
charioteer, and their rich manes were soiled as they drooped from beneath the
yoke-cushion on both sides beside the yoke. And when the son of Kronos beheld
them mourning he had compassion on them, and shook his head and spake to his
own heart: &ldquo;Ah, hapless pair, why gave we you to king Peleus, a mortal
man, while ye are deathless and ever young? Was it that ye should suffer
sorrows among ill-fated men? For methinketh there is nothing more piteous than
a man among all things that breathe and creep upon the earth. But verily Hector
Priam&rsquo;s son shall not drive you and your deftly-wrought car; that will I
not suffer. Is it a small thing that he holdeth the armour and vaunteth himself
vainly thereupon? Nay, I will put courage into your knees and heart that ye may
bring Automedon also safe out of the war to the hollow ships. For yet further
will I increase victory to the men of Troy, so that they slay until they come
unto the well-timbered ships, and the sun set and divine night come
down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he breathed good courage into the horses. And they shook to earth
the dust from their manes, and lightly bare the swift car amid Trojans and
Achaians. And behind them fought Automedon, albeit in grief for his comrade,
swooping with his chariot as a vulture on wild geese; for lightly he would flee
out of the onset of the Trojans and lightly charge, pursuing them through the
thick mellay. Yet could he not slay any man as he halted to pursue them, for it
was impossible that being alone in his sacred car he should at once assail them
with the spear and hold his fleet horses. Then at last espied him a comrade,
even Alkimedon son of Laerkes, son of Haimon, and he halted behind the car and
spake unto Automedon: &ldquo;Automedon, what god hath put into thy breast
unprofitable counsel and taken from thee wisdom, that thus alone thou art
fighting against the Trojans in the forefront of the press? Thy comrade even
now was slain, and Hector goeth proudly, wearing on his own shoulders the
armour of Aiakides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Automedon son of Diores answered him, saying: &ldquo;Alkimedon, what other
Achaian hath like skill to guide the spirit of immortal steeds, save only
Patroklos, peer of gods in counsel, while he yet lived? but now have death and
fate overtaken him. But take thou the lash and shining reins, and I will get me
down from my horses, that I may fight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and Alkimedon leapt on the fleet war-chariot and swiftly took
the lash and reins in his hands, and Automedon leapt down. And noble Hector
espied them, and straightway spake unto Aineias as he stood near:
&ldquo;Aineias, counsellor of mail-clad Trojans, I espy here the two horses of
fleet Aiakides come forth to battle with feeble charioteers. Therefore might I
hope to take them if thou in thy heart art willing, since they would not abide
our onset and stand to do battle against us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and the brave son of Anchises disregarded him not. And they
twain went right onward, their shoulders shielded by ox-hides dried and tough,
and bronze thick overlaid. And with them went both Chromios and godlike Aretos,
and their hearts were of high hope to slay the men and drive off the
strong-necked horses—fond hope, for not without blood lost were they to get
them back from Automedon. He praying to father Zeus was filled in his inmost
heart with valour and strength. And straightway he spake to Alkimedon, his
faithful comrade: &ldquo;Alkimedon, hold the horses not far from me, but with
their very breath upon my back; for I deem that Hector the son of Priam will
not refrain him from his fury until he mount behind Achilles&rsquo; horses of
goodly manes after slaying us twain, and dismay the ranks of Argive men, or
else himself fall among the foremost.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus said he, and called upon the Aiantes and Menelaos: &ldquo;Aiantes, leaders
of the Argives, and Menelaos, lo now, commit ye the corpse unto whoso may best
avail to bestride it and resist the ranks of men, and come ye to ward the day
of doom from us who are yet alive, for here in the dolorous war are Hector and
Aineias, the best men of the Trojans, pressing hard. Yet verily these issues
lie in the lap of the gods: I too will cast my spear, and the rest shall Zeus
decide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and poised his far-shadowing spear and hurled it, and smote on the
circle of the shield of Aretos, and the shield sustained not the spear, but
right through went the bronze, and he forced it into his belly low down through
his belt. And as when a strong man with a sharp axe smiting behind the horns of
an ox of the homestead cleaveth the sinew asunder, and the ox leapeth forward
and falleth, so leapt Aretos forward and fell on his back; and the spear in his
entrails very piercingly quivering unstrung his limbs. And Hector hurled at
Automedon with his bright spear, but he looked steadfastly on the bronze
javelin as it came at him and avoided it, for he stooped forward, and the long
spear fixed itself in the ground behind, and the javelin-butt quivered, and
there dread Ares took away its force. And then had they lashed at each other
with their swords hand to hand, had not the Aiantes parted them in their fury,
when they were come through the mellay at their comrades&rsquo; call. Before
them Hector and Aineias and godlike Chromios shrank backward and gave ground
and left Aretos wounded to the death as he lay. And Automedon, peer of swift
Ares, stripped off the armour of the dead, and spake exultingly: &ldquo;Verily,
I have a little eased my heart of grief for the death of Menoitios&rsquo; son,
albeit a worse man than him have I slain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he took up the gory spoils and set them in his car, and gat him
thereon, with feet and hands all bloody, as a lion that hath devoured a bull.
</p>

<p>
Now great-hearted Aias and Menelaos were aware of Zeus how he gave the Trojans
their turn to victory. First of these to speak was great Aias son of Telamon:
&ldquo;Ay me, now may any man, even though he be a very fool, know that father
Zeus himself is helping the Trojans. Come, let us ourselves devise some
excellent means, that we may both hale the corpse away and ourselves return
home to the joy of our friends, who grieve as they look hitherward and deem
that no longer shall the fury of man-slaying Hector&rsquo;s unapproachable hand
refrain itself, but fall upon the black ships. And would there were some
comrade to carry tidings with all speed unto the son of Peleus, since I deem
that he hath not even heard the grievous tidings, how his dear comrade is
slain. But nowhere can I behold such an one among the Achaians, for themselves
and their horses likewise are wrapped in darkness. O father Zeus, deliver thou
the sons of the Achaians from the darkness, and make clear sky and vouchsafe
sight unto our eyes. In the light be it that thou slayest us, since it is thy
good pleasure that we die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then fair-haired Menelaos departed glancing everywhither, as an eagle which men
say hath keenest sight of all birds under heaven, and though he be far aloft
the fleet-footed hare eludeth him not by crouching beneath a leafy bush, but
the eagle swoopeth thereon and swiftly seizeth her and taketh her life. Thus in
that hour, Menelaos fosterling of Zeus, ranged thy shining eyes everywhither
through the multitude of the host of thy comrades, if haply they might behold
Nestor&rsquo;s son yet alive. Him quickly he perceived at the left of the whole
battle, heartening his comrades and rousing them to fight. And fair-haired
Menelaos came and stood nigh and said unto him: &ldquo;Antilochos, fosterling
of Zeus, come hither that thou mayest learn woful tidings—would it had never
been. Ere now, I ween, thou too hast known by thy beholding that God rolleth
mischief upon the Danaans, and with the Trojans is victory. And slain is the
best man of the Achaians, Patroklos, and great sorrow is wrought for the
Danaans. But run thou to the ships of the Achaians and quickly tell this to
Achilles, if haply he may straightway rescue to his ship the naked corpse: but
his armour is held by Hector of the glancing helmet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and Antilochos had horror of the word he heard. And long time
speechlessness possessed him, and his eyes were filled with tears, and his full
voice choked. Yet for all this disregarded he not the bidding of Menelaos, but
set him to run, when he had given his armour to a noble comrade, Laodokos, who
close anigh him was wheeling his whole-hooved horses.
</p>

<p>
So him his feet bare out of the battle weeping, to Achilles son of Peleus
carrying an evil tale. But thy heart, Menelaos fosterling of Zeus, chose not to
stay to aid the wearied comrades from whom Antilochos departed, and great
sorrow was among the Pylians. But to them Menelaos sent noble Thrasymedes, and
himself went again to bestride the hero Patroklos. And he hasted and stood
beside the Aiantes and straightway spake to them: &ldquo;So have I sent that
man to the swift ships to go to fleet-footed Achilles. Yet deem I not that he
will now come, for all his wrath against noble Hector, for he could not fight
unarmed against the men of Troy. But let us ourselves devise some excellent
means, both how we may hale the dead away, and how we ourselves may escape
death and fate amid the Trojans&rsquo; battle-cry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then answered him great Aias Telamol&rsquo;s son, saying: &ldquo;All this hast
thou said well, most noble Menelaos. But do thou and Meriones put your
shoulders beneath the dead and lift him and bear him swiftly out of the fray,
while we twain behind you shall do battle with the Trojans and noble Hector,
one in heart as we are in name, for from of old time we are wont to await
fierce battle side by side.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and the others took the dead man in their arms and lifted him
mightily on high. But the Trojan host behind cried aloud when they saw the
Achaians lifting the corpse, and charged like hounds that spring in front of
hunter-youths upon a wounded wild boar, and for a while run in haste to rend
him, but when he wheeleth round among them, trusting in his might, then they
give ground and shrink back here and there. Thus for a while the Trojans
pressed on with all their power, striking with swords and double-headed spears,
but when the Aiantes turned about and halted over against them, then they
changed colour, and none dared farther onset to do battle around the dead.
