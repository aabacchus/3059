Of the funeral of Patroklos, and the funeral games.
</p>

<p>
Thus they throughout the city made moan: but the Achaians when they were come
to the ships and to the Hellespont were scattered each to his own ship: only
the Myrmidons Achilles suffered not to be scattered, but spake among his
comrades whose delight was in war: &ldquo;Fleet-horsed Myrmidons, my trusty
comrades, let us not yet unyoke our whole-hooved steeds from their cars, but
with horses and chariots let us go near and mourn Patroklos, for such is the
honour of the dead. Then when we have our fill of grievous wailing, we will
unyoke the horses and all sup here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and they with one accord made lamentation, and Achilles led their
mourning. So thrice around the dead they drave their well-maned steeds,
moaning; and Thetis stirred among them desire of wailing. Bedewed were the
sands with tears, bedewed the warriors&rsquo; arms; so great a lord of fear
they sorrowed for. And Peleus&rsquo; son led their loud wail, laying his
man-slaying hands on his comrade&rsquo;s breast: &ldquo;All hail, Patroklos,
even in the house of Hades; for all that I promised thee before am I
accomplishing, seeing I have dragged hither Hector to give raw unto dogs to
devour, and twelve noble children of the Trojans to slaughter before thy pyre,
because of mine anger at thy slaying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and devised foul entreatment of noble Hector, stretching him prone in
the dust beside the bier of Menoitios&rsquo; son. And the rest put off each his
glittering bronze arms, and unyoked their high-neighing horses, and sate them
down numberless beside the ship of fleet-footed Aiakides, and he gave them
ample funeral feast. Many sleek oxen were stretched out, their throats cut with
steel, and many sheep and bleating goats, and many white-tusked boars well
grown in fat were spitted to singe in the flame of Hephaistos; so on all sides
round the corpse in cupfuls blood was flowing.
</p>

<p>
But the fleet-footed prince, the son of Peleus, was brought to noble Agamemnon
by the Achaian chiefs, hardly persuading him thereto, for his heart was wroth
for his comrade. And when they were come to Agamemnol&rsquo;s hut, forthwith
they bade clear-voiced heralds set a great tripod on the fire, if haply they
might persuade the son of Peleus to wash from him the bloody gore. But he
denied them steadfastly, and sware moreover an oath: &ldquo;Nay, verily by
Zeus, who is highest and best of gods, not lawful is it that water should come
nigh my head or ever I shall have laid Patroklos on the fire, and heaped a
barrow, and shaved my hair, since never again shall second grief thus reach my
heart, while I remain among the living. Yet now for the present let us yield us
to our mournful meal: but with the morning, O king of men Agamemnon, rouse the
folk to bring wood and furnish all that it beseemeth a dead man to have when he
goeth beneath the misty gloom, to the end that untiring fire may burn him
quickly from sight, and the host betake them to their work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and they listened readily to him and obeyed, and eagerly making
ready each his meal they supped, and no lack had their soul of equal feast. But
when they had put off from them the desire of meat and drink, the rest went
down each man to his tent to take his rest, but the son of Peleus upon the
beach of the sounding sea lay groaning heavily, amid the host of Myrmidons, in
an open place, where waves were breaking on the shore. Now when sleep took hold
on him, easing the cares of his heart, deep sleep that fell about him, (for
sore tired were his glorious knees with onset upon Hector toward windy Ilios),
then came there unto him the spirit of hapless Patroklos, in all things like
his living self, in stature, and fair eyes, and voice, and the raiment of his
body was the same; and he stood above Achilles&rsquo; head and spake to him:
&ldquo;Thou sleepest, and hast forgotten me, O Achilles. Not in my life wast
thou ever unmindful of me, but in my death. Bury me with all speed, that I pass
the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish me, the phantoms of men outworn,
nor suffer me to mingle with them beyond the River, but vainly I wander along
the wide-gated dwelling of Hades. Now give me, I pray pitifully of thee, thy
hand, for never more again shall I come back from Hades, when ye have given me
my due of fire. Never among the living shall we sit apart from our dear
comrades and take counsel together, but me hath the harsh fate swallowed up
which was appointed me even from my birth. Yea and thou too thyself, Achilles
peer of gods, beneath the wall of the noble Trojans art doomed to die. Yet one
thing will I say, and charge thee, if haply thou wilt have regard thereto. Lay
not my bones apart from thine, Achilles, but together, even as we were nurtured
in your house, when Menoitios brought me yet a little one from Opoeis to your
country by reason of a grievous man-slaying, on the day when I slew
Amphidamas&rsquo; son, not willing it, in childish wrath over the dice. Then
took me the knight Peleus into his house and reared me kindly and named me thy
squire: so therefore let one coffer hide our bones [a golden coffer, two
handled, thy lady mother&rsquo;s gift].&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then made answer unto him Achilles fleet of foot: &ldquo;Wherefore, O my
brother, hast thou come hither, and chargest me everything that I should do?
Verily I will accomplish all, and have regard unto thy bidding. But stand more
nigh me; for one moment let us throw our arms around each other, and take our
fill of dolorous lament.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spake, and reached forth with his hands, but clasped him not; for like a
vapour the spirit was gone beneath the earth with a faint shriek. And Achilles
sprang up marvelling, and smote his hands together, and spake a word of woe:
&ldquo;Ay me, there remaineth then even in the house of Hades a spirit and
phantom of the dead, albeit the life be not anywise therein: for all night long
hath the spirit of hapless Patroklos stood over me, wailing and making moan,
and charged me everything that I should do, and wondrous like his living self
it seemed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus said he, and stirred in all of them yearning to make lament; and
rosy-fingered Morn shone forth on them while they still made moan around the
piteous corpse. Then lord Agamemnon sped mules and men from all the huts to
fetch wood; and a man of valour watched thereover, even Meriones, squire of
kindly Idomeneus. And they went forth with wood-cutting axes in their hands and
well-woven ropes, and before them went the mules, and uphill and downhill and
sideways and across they went. But when they came to the spurs of
many-fountained Ida, straightway they set them lustily to hew high-foliaged
oaks with the long-edged bronze, and with loud noise fell the trees. Then
splitting them asunder the Achaians bound them behind the mules, and they tore
up the earth with their feet as they made for the plain through the thick
underwood. And all the wood-cutters bare logs; for thus bade Meriones, squire
of kindly Idomeneus. And on the Shore they threw them down in line, where
Achilles purposed a mighty tomb for Patroklos and for himself.
</p>

<p>
Then when they had laid down all about great piles of wood, they sate them down
all together and abode. Then straightway Achilles bade the warlike Myrmidons
gird on their arms and each yoke the horses to his chariot; and they arose and
put their armour on, and mounted their chariots, both fighting men and
charioteers. In front were the men in chariots, and a cloud of footmen followed
after, numberless; and in the midst his comrades bare Patroklos. And they
heaped all the corpse with their hair that they cut off and threw thereon; and
behind did goodly Achilles bear the head, sorrowing; for a noble comrade was he
speeding forth unto the realm of Hades.
</p>

<p>
And when they came to the place where Achilles had bidden them, they set down
the dead, and piled for him abundant wood. Then fleet-footed noble Achilles
bethought him of one thing more: standing apart from the pyre he shore off a
golden lock, the lock whose growth he nursed to offer unto the River
Spercheios, and sore troubled spake be, looking forth over the wine-dark sea:
&ldquo;Spercheios, in other wise vowed my father Peleus unto thee that I
returning thither to my native land should shear my hair for thee and offer a
holy hecatomb, and fifty rams should sacrifice there above thy springs, where
is the sacred close and altar burning spice. So vowed the old man, but thou
hast not accomplished him his desire. And now since I return not to my dear
native land, unto the hero Patroklos I may give this hair to take away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he set the hair in the hands of his dear comrade, and stirred in
all of them yearning to make lament. And so would the light of the sun have
gone down on their lamentation, had not Achilles said quickly to Agamemnon as
he stood beside him: &ldquo;Son of Atreus—for to thy words most will the host
of the Achaians have regard—of lamentation they may sate them to the full. But
now disperse them from the burning and bid them make ready their meal, and we
to whom the dead is dearest will take pains for these things; yet let the
chiefs tarry nigh unto us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then when Agamemnon king of men heard that, he forthwith dispersed the host
among the trim ships, but the nearest to the dead tarried there and piled the
wood, and made a pyre a hundred feet this way and that, and on the pyre&rsquo;s
top set the corpse, with anguish at their hearts. And many lusty sheep and
shambling crook-horned oxen they flayed and made ready before the pyre; and
taking from all of them the fat, great hearted Achilles wrapped the corpse
therein from head to foot, and heaped the flayed bodies round. And he set
therein two-handled jars of honey and oil, leaning them against the bier; and
four strong-necked horses he threw swiftly on the pyre, and groaned aloud. Nine
house-dogs had the dead chief: of them did Achilles slay twain and throw them
on the pyre. And twelve valiant sons of great-hearted Trojans he slew with the
sword—for he devised mischief in his heart and he set to the merciless might of
the fire, to feed thereon. Then moaned he aloud, and called on his dear comrade
by his name: &ldquo;All hail to thee, O Patroklos, even in the house of Hades,
for all that I promised thee before am I now accomplishing. Twelve valiant sons
of great-hearted Trojans, behold these all in company with thee the fire
devoureth: but Hector son of Priam will I nowise give to the fire to feed upon,
but to dogs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he threatening, but no dogs might deal with Hector, for day and
night Aphrodite daughter of Zeus kept off the dogs, and anointed him with
rose-sweet oil ambrosial that Achilles might not tear him when he dragged him.
And over him Phoebus Apollo brought a dark cloud from heaven to earth and
covered all that place whereon the dead man lay, lest meanwhile the sul&rsquo;s
strength shrivel his flesh round about upon his sinews and limbs.
</p>

<p>
But the pyre of dead Patroklos kindled not. Then fleet-footed noble Achilles
had a further thought: standing aside from the pyre he prayed to the two Winds
of North and West, and promised them fair offerings, and pouring large
libations from a golden cup besought them to come, that the corpses might blaze
up speedily in the fire, and the wood make haste to be enkindled. Then Iris,
when she heard his prayer, went swiftly with the message to the Winds. They
within the house of the gusty West Wind were feasting all together at meat,
when Iris sped thither, and halted on the threshold of stone. And when they saw
her with their eyes, they sprang up and called to her every one to sit by him.
But she refused to sit, and spake her word: &ldquo;No seat for me; I must go
back to the streams of Ocean, to the Ethiopians&rsquo; land where they
sacrifice hecatombs to the immortal gods, that I too may feast at their rites.
But Achilles is praying the North Wind and the loud West to come, and promising
them fair offerings, that ye may make the pyre be kindled whereon lieth
Patroklos, for whom all the Achaians are making moan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She having thus said departed, and they arose with a mighty sound, rolling the
clouds before them. And swiftly they came blowing over the sea, and the wave
rose beneath their shrill blast; and they came to deep-soiled Troy, and fell
upon the pile, and loudly roared the mighty fire. So all night drave they the
flame of the pyre together, blowing shrill; and all night fleet Achilles,
holding a two-handled cup, drew wine from a golden bowl, and poured it forth
and drenched the earth, calling upon the spirit of hapless Patroklos. As a
father waileth when he burneth the bones of his son, new-married, whose death
is woe to his hapless parents, so wailed Achilles as he burnt the bones of his
comrade, going heavily round the burning pile, with many moans.
</p>

<p>
But at the hour when the Morning star goeth forth to herald light upon the
earth, the star that saffron-mantled Dawn cometh after, and spreadeth over the
salt sea, then grew the burning faint, and the flame died down. And the Winds
went back again to betake them home over the Thracian main, and it roared with
a violent swell. Then the son of Peleus turned away from the burning and lay
down wearied, and sweet sleep leapt on him. But they who were with
Atreus&rsquo; son gathered all together, and the noise and clash of their
approach aroused him; and he sate upright and spake a word to them: &ldquo;Son
of Atreus and ye other chiefs of the Achaians, first quench with gleaming wine
all the burning so far as the fire&rsquo;s strength hath reached, and then let
us gather up the bones of Patroklos, Menoitios&rsquo; son, singling them well,
and easy are they to discern, for he lay in the middle of the pyre, while the
rest apart at the edge burnt-confusedly, horses and men. And his bones let us
put within a golden urn, and double-folded fat, until that I myself be hidden
in Hades. But no huge barrow I bid you toil to raise—a seemly one, no more:
then afterward do ye Achaians build it broad and high, whosoever of you after I
am gone may be left in the benched ships.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and they hearkened to the fleet-footed son of Peleus. First
quenched they with gleaming wine the burning so far as the flame went, and the
ash had settled deep: then with lamentation they gathered up the white bones of
their gentle comrade into a golden urn and double-folded fat, and placed the
urn in the hut and covered it with a linen veil. And they marked the circle of
the barrow, and set the foundations thereof around the pyre, and straightway
heaped thereon a heap of earth. Then when they had heaped up the barrow they
were for going back. But Achilles stayed the folk in that place, and made them
sit in wide assembly, and from his ships he brought forth prizes, caldrons and
tripods, and horses and mules and strong oxen, and fair-girdled women, and grey
iron.
</p>

<p>
First for fleet chariot-racers he ordained a noble prize, a woman skilled in
fair handiwork for the winner to lead home, and an eared tripod that held
two-and-twenty measures; these for the first man; and for the second he
ordained a six-year-old mare unbroke with a mule foal in her womb; and for the
third he gave a goodly caldron yet untouched by fire, holding four measures,
bright as when first made; and for the fourth he ordained two talents of gold;
and for the fifth a two-handled urn untouched of fire, Then he stood up and
spake a word among the Argives: &ldquo;Son of Atreus and ye other well-greaved
Achaians, for the chariot-racers these prizes lie awaiting them in the lists.
If in some other&rsquo;s honour we Achaians were now holding our games, it
would be I who should win the first prize and bear it to my hut; for ye know
how far my pair of horses are first in excellence, for they are immortal and
Poseidon gave them to my father Peleus, and he again to me. But verily I will
abide, I and my whole-hooved horses, so glorious a charioteer have they lost,
and one so kind, who on their manes full often poured smooth oil, when he had
washed them in clear water. For him they stand and mourn, and their manes are
trailing on the ground, and there stand they with sorrow at their hearts. But
ye others throughout the host get ye to your places, whosoever of the Achalans
hath trust in his horses and firm-jointed car.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake the son of Peleus, and the fleet chariot-racers were gathered. First
of all arose up Eumelos king of men, Admetos&rsquo; son, a skilful charioteer;
and next to him arose Tydeus&rsquo; son, valiant Diomedes, and yoked his horses
of the breed of Tros, which on a time he seized from Aineias, when Apollo saved
their lord. And after him arose Atreus&rsquo; son, fair-haired heaven-sprung
Menelaos, and yoked him a swift pair Aithe, Agamemnol&rsquo;s mare, and his own
horse Podargos. Her unto Agamemnon did Anchises&rsquo; son Echepolos give in
fee, that he might escape from following him to windy Ilios and take his
pleasure at home; for great wealth had Zeus given him, and he dwelt in Sikyon
of spacious lawns:— so Menelaos yoked her, and she longed exceedingly for the
race. And fourth, Antilochos made ready his fair-maned horses, even the noble
son of Nestor, high-hearted king, who was the son of Neleus; and fleet horses
bred at Pylos drew his car. And his father standing by his side spake
counselling him to his profit, though himself was well advised:
&ldquo;Antilochos, verily albeit thou art young, Zeus and Poseidon have loved
thee and taught thee all skill with horses; wherefore to teach thee is no great
need, for thou well knowest how to wheel round the post; yet are thy horses
very slow in the race: therefore methinks there will be sad work for thee. For
the horses of the others are fleeter, yet the men know not more cunning than
thou hast. So come, dear son, store thy mind with all manner of cunning, that
the prize escape thee not. By cunning is a woodman far better than by force; by
cunning doth a helmsman on the wine-dark deep steer his swift ship buffeted by
winds; by cunning hath charioteer the better of charioteer. For whoso trusting
in his horses and car alone wheeleth heedlessly and wide at either end, his
horses swerve on the course, and he keepeth them not in hand. But whoso is of
crafty mind, though he drive worse horses, he ever keeping his eye upon the
post turneth closely by it, neither is unaware how far at first to force his
horses by the ox-hide reins, but holdeth them safe in hand and watcheth the
leader in the race. Now will I tell thee a certain sign, and it shall not
escape thee. A fathom&rsquo;s height above the ground standeth a withered
stump, whether of oak or pine: it decayeth not in the rain, and two white
stones on either side thereof are fixed at the joining of the track, and all
round it is smooth driving ground. Whether it be a monument of some man dead
long ago, or have been made their goal in the race by ancient men, this now is
the mark fixed by fleet-footed Achilles. Wherefore do thou drive close and bear
thy horses and chariot hard thereon, and lean thy body on the well-knit car
slightly to their left, and call upon the off-horse with voice and lash, and
give him rein from thy hand. But let the near horse hug the post so that the
nave of the well-wrought wheel seem to graze it—yet beware of touching the
stone, lest thou wound the horses and break the chariot; so would that be
triumph to the rest and reproach unto thyself. But, dear son, be wise and on
thy guard; for if at the turning-post thou drive past the rest, there is none
shall overtake thee from behind or pass thee by, not though he drave the goodly
Arion in pursuit, the fleet horse of Adrastos, of divine descent, or the horses
of Laomedon, best of all bred in this land.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake Neleian Nestor and sate him down again in his place, when he had
told his son the sum of every matter.
</p>

<p>
And Meriones was the fifth to make ready his sleek-coated steeds. Then went
they up into their chariots, and cast in the lots: and Achilles shook them, and
forth leapt the lot of Antilochos Nestor&rsquo;s son, and the next lot had lord
Eumelos, and next to him the son of Atreus, spear-famed Menelaos, and next to
him drew Meriones his place; then lastly Tydeides, far the best of all, drew
his lot for his chariot&rsquo;s place. Then they stood side by side, and
Achilles showed to them the turning post, far off in the smooth plain; and
beside it he placed an umpire, godlike Phoinix, his father&rsquo;s follower,
that he might note the running and tell the truth thereof.
</p>

<p>
Then all together lifted the lash above their steeds, and smote them with the
reins, and called on them eagerly with words: and they forthwith sped swiftly
over the plain, leaving the ships behind; and beneath their breasts stood the
rising dust like a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes waved on the blowing
wind. And the chariots ran sometimes on the bounteous earth, and other whiles
would bound into the air. And the drivers stood in the cars, and the heart of
every man beat in desire of victory, and they called every man to his horses,
that flew amid their dust across the plain.
</p>

<p>
But when the fleet horses were now running the last part of the course, back
toward the grey sea, then was manifest the prowess of each, and the horses
strained in the race; and presently to the front rushed the fleet mares of
Pheres&rsquo; grandson, and next to them Diomedes&rsquo; stallions of the breed
of Tros, not far apart, but hard anigh, for they seemed ever as they would
mount Eumelos&rsquo; car, and with their breath his back was warm and his broad
shoulders, for they bent their heads upon him as they flew along. Thus would
Tydeus&rsquo; son have either outstripped the other or made it a dead heat, had
not Phoebus Apollo been wroth with him and smitten from his hand the shining
lash. Then from his eyes ran tears of anger, for that he saw the mares still at
speed, even swiftlier than before, while his own horses were thrown out, as
running without spur. But Athene was not unaware of Apollo&rsquo;s guile
against Tydeides, and presently sped after the shepherd of hosts, and gave him
back the lash, and put spirit into his steeds. Then in wrath after the son of
Admetos was the goddess gone, and brake his steeds&rsquo; yoke, and the mares
ran sideways off the course, and the pole was twisted to the ground. And
Eumelos was hurled out of the car beside the wheel, and his elbows and mouth
and nose were flayed, and his forehead bruised above his eyebrows; and his eyes
filled with tears and his lusty voice was choked. Then Tydeides held his
whole-hooved horses on one side, darting far out before the rest, for Athene
put spirit into his steeds and shed glory on himself. Now next after him came
golden-haired Menelaos Atreus&rsquo; son. But Antilochos called to his
father&rsquo;s horses: &ldquo;Go ye too in, strain to your fleetest pace. Truly
I nowise bid you strive with those, the horses of wise Tydeides, unto which
Athene hath now given speed, and shed glory on their charioteer. But overtake
Atreides&rsquo; horses with all haste, and be not outstripped by them, lest
Aithe that is but a mare pour scorn on you. Why are ye outstripped, brave
steeds? Thus will I tell you, and verily it shall be brought to pass—ye will
find no tendance with Nestor shepherd of hosts, but straightway he will slay
you with the edge of the sword if through heedlessness we win but the worse
prize. Have after them at your utmost speed, and I for my part will devise a
plan to pass them in the strait part of the course, and this shall fail me
not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and they fearing the voice of the prince ran swiftlier some
little while; and presently did the good warrior Antilochos espy a strait place
in a sunk part of the way. There was a rift in the earth, where torrent water
gathered and brake part of the track away, and hollowed all the place; there
drave Menelaos, shunning the encounter of the wheels. But Antilochos turned his
whole-hooved horses out of the track, and followed him a little at one side.
And the son of Atreus took alarm and shouted to Antilochos: &ldquo;Antilochos,
thou art driving recklessly—hold in thy horses! The road is straitened, soon
thou mayest pass me in a wider place, lest thou foul my chariot and undo us
both.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, but Antilochos drave even fiercelier than before, plying his
lash, as though he heard him not. As far as is the range of a disk swung from
the shoulder when a young man hurleth it, making trial of his force, even so
far ran they on; then the mares of Atreus&rsquo; son gave back, for he ceased
of himself to urge them on, lest the whole-hooved steeds should encounter on
the track, and overset the well-knit cars, and the drivers fall in the dust in
their zeal for victory. So upbraiding Antilochos spake golden-haired Menelaos:
&ldquo;Antilochos, no mortal man is more malicious than thou. Go thy mad way,
since falsely have we Achaians called thee wise. Yet even so thou shalt not
bear off the prize unchallenged to an oath.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he called aloud to his horses: &ldquo;Hold ye not back nor stand
still with sorrow at heart. Their feet and knees will grow weary before yours,
for they both lack youth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and they fearing the voice of the prince sped faster on, and
were quickly close upon the others.
</p>

<p>
Now the Argives sitting in concourse were gazing at the horses, and they came
flying amid their dust over the plain. And the first aware of them was
Idomeneus, chief of the Cretans, for he was sitting outside the concourse in
the highest place of view, and when he heard the voice of one that shouted,
though afar off, he knew it; and he was aware of a horse showing plainly in the
front, a chestnut all the rest of him, but in the forehead marked with a white
star round like the moon. And he stood upright and spoke among the Argives:
&ldquo;Friends, chiefs, and counsellors of the Argives, is it I alone who see
the horses, or do ye also? A new pair seem to me now to be in front, and a new
charioteer appeareth; the mares which led in the outward course must have been
thrown out there in the plain. For I saw them turning first the hither post,
but now can see them nowhere, though my eyes are gazing everywhere along the
Trojan plain. Did the reins escape the charioteer so that he could not drive
aright round the post and failed in the turn? There, methinks, must he have
been cast forth, and have broken his chariot, and the mares must have left the
course, in the wildness of their heart. But stand up ye too and look, for
myself I discern not certainly, but the first man seemeth to me one of Aitolian
race, and he ruleth among Argives, the son of horse-taming Tydeus, stalwart
Diomedes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then fleet Aias Oileus&rsquo; son rebuked him in unseemly sort:
&ldquo;Idomeneus, why art thou a braggart of old? As yet far off the
high-stepping mares are coursing over the wide plain. Neither art thou so far
the youngest among the Argives, nor do thy eyes look so far the keenliest from
thy head, yet continually braggest thou. It beseemeth thee not to be a
braggart, for there are here better men. And the mares leading are they that
led before, Eumelos&rsquo; mares, and he standeth and holdeth the reins within
the car.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then wrathfully in answer spake the chief of Cretans: &ldquo;Aias, master of
railing, ill-counselled, in all else art thou behind other Argives, for thy
mind is unfriendly. Come then let us wager a tripod or caldron, and make
Agamemnon Atreus&rsquo; son our umpire, which mares are leading, that thou
mayest pay and learn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus said he, and straightway fleet Aias Oileus&rsquo; son arose angrily to
answer with harsh words: and strife between the twain would have gone further,
had not Achilles himself stood up and spake a word: &ldquo;No longer answer
each other with harsh words, Aias and Idomeneus, ill words, for it beseemeth
not. Surely ye are displeased with any other who should do thus. Sit ye in the
concourse and keep your eyes upon the horses; soon they in zeal for victory
will come hither, and then shall ye know each of you the Argives&rsquo; horses,
which follow, and which lead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and the son of Tydeus came driving up, and with his lash smote now and
again from the shoulder, and his horses were stepping high as they sped swiftly
on their way. And sprinklings of dust smote ever the charioteer, and his
chariot overlaid with gold and tin ran behind his fleet-footed steeds, and
small trace was there of the wheel-tires behind in the fine dust, as they flew
speeding on. Then he drew up in the mid concourse, and much sweat poured from
the horses&rsquo; heads and chests to the ground. And Diomedes leapt to earth
from the shining car, and leant his lash against the yoke. Then stalwart
Sthenelos tarried not, but promptly took the prize, and gave to his proud
comrades the woman to lead and the eared tripod to bear away, and he loosed the
horses from the yoke.
</p>

<p>
And next after him drave Neleian Antilochos his horses, by craft, not
swiftness, having passed by Menelaos; yet even now Menelaos held his swift
steeds hard anigh. As far as a horse is from the wheel, which draweth his
master, straining with the car over the plain—his hindmost tail-hairs touch the
tire, for the wheel runneth hard anigh nor is much space between, as he
speedeth far over the plain—by so much was Menelaos behind high-born
Antilochos, howbeit at first he was a whole disk-cast behind, but quickly he
was catching Antilochos up, for the high mettle of Agamemnol&rsquo;s mare,
sleek-coated Aithe, was rising in her. And if yet further both had had to run
he would have passed his rival nor left it even a dead heat. But Meriones,
stout squire of Idomeneus, came in a spear-throw behind famous Menelaos, for
tardiest of all were his sleek-coated horses, and slowest he himself to drive a
chariot in the race. Last of them all came Admetos&rsquo; son, dragging his
goodly car driving his steeds in front. Him when fleet-footed noble Achilles
beheld he pitied him, and he stood up and spake winged words among the Argives:
&ldquo;Last driveth his whole-hooved horses the best man of them all. But come
let us give him a prize, as is seemly, prize for the second place, but the
first let the son of Tydeus take.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and all applauded that he bade. And he would have given him the
mare, for the Achaians applauded, had not Antilochos, son of great-hearted
Nestor; risen up and answered Peleian Achilles on behalf of his right: &ldquo;O
Achilles, I shall be sore angered with thee if thou accomplish this word, for
thou art minded to take away my prize, because thou thinkest of how his chariot
and fleet steeds miscarried, and himself withal, good man though he be. Nay, it
behoved him to pray to the Immortals, then would he not have come in last of
all in the race. But if thou pitiest him and he be dear to thy heart, there is
much gold in thy hut, bronze is there and sheep, hand-maids are there and
whole-hooved horses. Thereof take thou and give unto him afterward even a
richer prize, or even now at once, that the Achaians may applaud thee. But the
mare I will not yield; for her let what man will essay the battle at my
hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and fleet-footed noble Achilles smiled, pleased with Antilochos,
for he was his dear comrade; and spake in answer to him winged words:
&ldquo;Antilochos, if thou wouldst have me give Eumelos some other thing beside
from out my house, that also will I do. I will give unto him a breast-plate
that I took from Asteropaios, of bronze, whereon a casting of bright tin is
overlaid, and of great worth will it be to him.&rdquo; He said, and bade his
dear comrade Automedon bring it from the hut, and he went and brought it. [Then
he placed it in Eumelos&rsquo; hands, and he received it gladly.]
</p>

<p>
But Menelaos also arose among them, sore at heart, angered exceedingly against
Antilochos; and the herald set the staff in his hand, and called for silence
among the Argives; then spake among them that godlike man: &ldquo;Antilochos,
who once wert wise, what thing is this thou hast done? Thou hast shamed my
skill and made my horses fail, thrusting thine own in front that are far worse.
Come now, ye chiefs and counsellors of the Argives, give judgment between us
both, and favour neither: lest some one of the mail-clad Achalans say at any
time: &lsquo;By constraining Antilochos through false words hath Menelaos gone
off with the mare, for his horses were far worse, howbeit he hath advantage in
rank and power.&rsquo; Nay, I myself will bring the issue about, and I deem
that none other of the Danaans shall reproach me, for the trial shall be just.
Antilochos, fosterling of Zeus, come thou hither and as it is ordained stand up
before thy horses and chariot and take in thy hand the pliant lash wherewith
thou dravest erst, and touching thy horses swear by the Enfolder and Shaker of
the earth that not wilfully didst thou hinder my chariot by guile.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then answered him wise Antilochos: &ldquo;Bear with me now, for far younger am
I than thou, king Menelaos, and thou art before me and my better. Thou knowest
how a young mal&rsquo;s transgressions come about, for his mind is hastier and
his counsel shallow. So let thy heart suffer me, and I will of myself give to
thee the mare I have taken. Yea, if thou shouldst ask some other greater thing
from my house, I were fain to give it thee straightway, rather than fall for
ever from my place in thy heart, O fosterling of Zeus, and become a sinner
against the gods.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake great-hearted Nestor&rsquo;s son, and brought the mare and put her
in the hand of Menelaos. And his heart was gladdened as when the dew cometh
upon the ears of ripening harvest-corn, what time the fields are bristling. So
gladdened was thy soul, Menelaos, within thy heart. And he spake unto
Antilochos and uttered winged words: &ldquo;Antilochos, now will I of myself
put away mine anger against thee, since no wise formerly wert thou flighty or
light-minded, howbeit now thy reason was overcome of youthfulness. Another time
be loth to outwit better men. Not easily should another of the Achaians have
persuaded me, but thou hast suffered and toiled greatly, and thy brave father
and brother, for my sake: therefore will I hearken to thy prayer, and will even
give unto thee the mare, though she is mine, that these also may know that my
heart was never overweening or implacable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said, and gave the mare to Noemon Antilochos&rsquo; comrade to lead away,
and then took the shining caldron. And Meriones took up the two talents of gold
in the fourth place, as he had come in. So the fifth prize was left unclaimed,
a two-handled cup; to Nester gave Achilles this, bearing it to him through the
concourse of Argives, and stood by him and said: &ldquo;Lo now for thee too,
old man, be this a treasure, a memorial of Patroklos&rsquo; burying; for no
more shalt thou behold him among the Argives. Now give I thee this prize unwon,
for not in boxing shalt thou strive, neither wrestle, nor enter on the javelin
match, nor race with thy feet; for grim old age already weigheth on
thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying he placed it in his hand, and Nestor received it gladly, and spake
unto him winged words: &ldquo;Ay, truly all this, my son, thou hast meetly
said; for no longer are my limbs, friend, firm, nor my feet, nor do my arms at
all swing lightly from my shoulders either side. Would that my youth were such
and my force so firm as when the Epeians were burying lord Amarynkes at
Buprasion, and his sons held the king&rsquo;s funeral games. Then was no man
found like me, neither of the Epeians nor of the Pylians themselves or the
great-hearted Aitolians. In boxing I overcame Klytomedes, son of Enops, and in
wrestling Ankaios of Pleuron, who stood up against me, and in the foot-race I
outran Iphiklos, a right good man, and with the spear outthrew Phyleus and
Polydoros; only in the chariot-race the two sons of Aktor beat me [by crowding
their horses in front of me, jealous for victory, because the chief prizes were
left at home.] Now they were twins—one ever held the reins, the reins he ever
held, the other called on the horses with the lash. Thus was I once, but now
let younger men join in such feats; I must bend to grievous age, but then was I
of mark among heroes. But come hold funeral for thy comrade too with with
games. This gift do I accept with gladness, and my heart rejoiceth that thou
rememberest ever my friendship to thee—(nor forget I thee)—and the honour
wherewith it is meet that I be honoured among the Achaians. And may the gods
for this grant thee due grace.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and Peleides was gone down the full concourse of Achaians, when
he had hearkened to all the thanks of Neleus&rsquo; son. Then he ordained
prizes of the violent boxing match; a sturdy mule he led forth and tethered
amid the assembly, a six-year mule unbroken, hardest of all to break; and for
the loser set a two-handled cup. Then he stood up and spake a word among the
Argives: &ldquo;Son of Atreus and ye other well-greaved Achaians, for these
rewards we summon two men of the best to lift up their hands to box amain. He
to whom Apollo shall grant endurance to the end, and all the Achaians
acknowledge it, let him take the sturdy mule and return with her to his hut;
and the loser shall take with him the two-handled-cup.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and forthwith arose a man great and valiant and skilled in
boxing, Epeios son of Panopeus, and laid his hand on the sturdy mule and said
aloud: &ldquo;Let one come nigh to bear off the two-handled cup; the mule I say
none other of the Achaians shall take for victory with his fists, for I claim
to be the best man here. Sufficeth it not that I fall short of you in battle?
Not possible is it that in all arts a man be skilled. Thus proclaim I, and it
shall be accomplished: I will utterly bruise mine adversary&rsquo;s flesh and
break his bones, so let his friends abide together here to bear him forth when
vanquished by my hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and they all kept deep silence. And alone arose against him
Euryalos, a godlike man, son of king Mekisteus the son of Talaos, Mekisteus,
who came on a time to Thebes when Oedipus had fallen, to his burial, and there
he overcame all the sons of Kadmos. Thus Tydeides famous with the spear made
ready Euryalos for the fight, cheering him with speech, and greatly desired for
him victory. And first he cast about him a girdle, and next gave him well-cut
thongs of the hide of an ox of the field. And the two boxers being girt went
into the midst of the ring, and both lifting up their stalwart hands fell to,
and their hands joined battle grievously. Then was there terrible grinding of
teeth, and sweat flowed from all their limbs. And noble Epeios came on, and as
the other spied for an opening, smote him on the cheek, nor could he much more
stand, for his limbs failed straightway under him. And as when beneath the
North Wind&rsquo;s ripple a fish leapeth on a tangle-covered beach, and then
the black wave hideth it, so leapt up Euryalos at that blow. But great-hearted
Epeios took him in his hands and set him upright, and his dear comrades stood
around him, and led him through the ring with trailing feet, spitting out
clotted blood, drooping his head awry, and they set him down in his swoon among
them and themselves went forth and fetched the two-handled cup.
</p>

<p>
Then Peleus&rsquo; son ordained straightway the prizes for a third contest,
offering them to the Danaans, for the grievous wrestling match: for the winner
a great tripod for standing on the fire, prized by the Achaians among them at
twelve oxens&rsquo; worth; and for the loser he brought a woman into the midst,
skilled in manifold work, and they prized her at four oxen. And he stood up and
spake a word among the Argives: &ldquo;Rise, ye who will essay this
match.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus said he, and there arose great Aias son of Telamon, and Odysseus of many
wiles stood up, the crafty-minded. And the twain being girt went into the midst
of the ring, and clasped each the other in his arms with stalwart hands, like
gable rafters of a lofty house which some famed craftsman joineth, that he may
baffle the wind&rsquo;s force. And their backs creaked, gripped firmly under
the vigorous hands, and sweat ran down in streams, and frequent weals along
their ribs and shoulders sprang up, red with blood, while ever they strove
amain for victory, to win the wrought tripod. Neither could Odysseus trip Aias
and bear him to the ground, nor Aias him, for Odysseus&rsquo; strength withheld
him. But when they began to irk the well-greaved Achaians, then said to
Odysseus great Aias, Telamol&rsquo;s son: &ldquo;Heaven-sprung son of Laertes,
Odysseus of many wiles, or lift thou me, or I will thee, and the issue shall be
with Zeus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Having thus said he lifted him, but Odysseus was not unmindful of his craft. He
smote deftly from behind the hollow of Aias&rsquo; knee, and loosed his limbs,
and threw him down backward, and Odysseus fell upon his chest, and the folk
gazed and marvelled. Then in his turn much-enduring noble Odysseus tried to
lift, and moved him a little from the ground, but lifted him not, so he crooked
his knee within the other&rsquo;s, and both fell on the ground nigh to each
other, and were soiled with dust, And now starting up again a third time would
they have wrestled, had not Achilles himself arisen and held them back:
&ldquo;No longer press each the other, nor wear you out with pain. Victory is
with both; take equal prizes and depart, that other Achaians may
contend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and they were fain to hear and to obey, and wiped the dust from
them and put their doublets on.
</p>

<p>
Then straightway the son of Peleus set forth other prizes for fleetness of
foot; a mixing-bowl of silver, chased; six measures it held, and in beauty it
was far the best in all the earth, for artificers of Sidon wrought it
cunningly, and men of the Phoenicians brought it over the misty sea, and landed
it in harbour, and gave it a gift to Thoas; and Euneos son of Jason gave it to
the hero Patroklos a ransom for Lykaon Priam&rsquo;s son. Now this cup did
Achilles set forth as a prize in honour of his friend, for whoso should be
fleetest in speed of foot. For the second he set an ox great and very fat, and
for the last prize half a talent of gold. And he stood up and spake a word
among the Argives: &ldquo;Rise, ye who will essay this match.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and straightway arose fleet Aias Oileus&rsquo; son, and Odysseus
of many wiles, and after them Nestor&rsquo;s son Antilochos, for he was best of
all the youth in the foot-race. Then they stood side by side, and Achilles
showed to them the goal. Right eager was the running from the start, but
Oileus&rsquo; son forthwith shot to the front, and close behind him came noble
Odysseus, as close as is a weaving-rod to a fair-girdled womal&rsquo;s breast
when she pulleth it deftly with her hands, drawing the spool along the warp,
and holdeth the rod nigh her breast— so close ran Odysseus behind Aias and trod
in his footsteps or ever the dust had settled there, and on his head fell the
breath of noble Odysseus as he ran ever lightly on, and all the Achaians
applauded his struggle for the victory and called on him as he laboured hard.
But when they were running the last part of the course, forthwith Odysseus
prayed in his soul to bright-eyed Athene: &ldquo;Hearken, goddess, come thou a
good helper of my feet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus prayed he, and Pallas Athene hearkened to him, and made his limbs feel
light, both feet and hands. But when they, were now nigh darting on the prize,
then Aias slipped as he ran, for Athene marred his race, where filth was strewn
from the slaughter of loud-bellowing oxen that fleet Achilles slew in honour of
Patroklos: and Aias&rsquo; mouth and nostrils were filled with that filth of
oxen. So much-enduring noble Odysseus, as he came in first, took up the
mixing-bowl, and famous Aias took the ox. And he stood holding in his hand the
horn of the ox of the field, sputtering away the filth, and spake among the
Argives: &ldquo;Out on it, it was the goddess who marred my running, she who
from of old like a mother standeth by Odysseus&rsquo; side and helpeth
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, but they all laughed pleasantly to behold him. Then Antilochos
smiling bore off the last prize, and spake his word among the Argives:
&ldquo;Friends, ye will all bear me witness when I say that even herein also
the immortals favour elder men. For Aias is a little older than I, but Odysseus
of an earlier generation and earlier race of men. A green old age is his, they
say, and hard were it for any Achaian to rival him in speed, save only
Achilles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, and gave honour to the fleet son of Peleus. And Achilles
answered him and said: &ldquo;Antilochos, not unheeded shall thy praise be
given; a half-talent of gold I will give thee over and above.&rdquo; He said,
and set it in his hands, and Antilochos received it gladly.
</p>

<p>
Then Peleus&rsquo; son brought and set in the ring a far-shadowing spear and a
chaldron that knew not the fire, an ox&rsquo;s worth, embossed with flowers;
and men that were casters of the javelin arose up. There rose Atreus&rsquo; son
wide-ruling Agamemnon, and Meriones, Idomeneus&rsquo; brave squire. And
swift-footed noble Achilles spake among them: &ldquo;Son of Atreus, for that we
know how far thou excellest all, and how far the first thou art in the might of
thy throw, take thou this prize with thee to the hollow ships, and to the hero
Meriones let us give the spear, if thou art willing in thy heart: thus I at
least advise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus spake he, nor disregarded him Agamemnon king of men. So to Meriones he
gave the spear of bronze, but to the herald Talthybios the hero gave the
goodliest prize.
