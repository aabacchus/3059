<h2><a name="chap14"></a>BOOK XIV.</h2>

<p class="letter">
How Sleep and Hera beguiled Zeus to slumber on the heights of Ida, and Poseidon
spurred on the Achaians to resist Hector, and how Hector was wounded.
</p>

<p>
Yet the cry of battle escaped not Nestor, albeit at his wine, but he spake
winged words to the son of Asklepios: &ldquo;Bethink thee, noble Machaon, what
had best be done; lo, louder waxes the cry of the strong warriors by the ships.
Nay, now sit where thou art, and drink the bright wine, till Hekamede of the
fair tresses shall heat warm water for the bath, and wash away the clotted
blood, but I will speedily go forth and come to a place of outlook.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Therewith he took the well-wrought shield of his son, horse-taming Thrasymedes,
which was lying in the hut, all glistering with bronze, for the son had the
shield of his father. And he seized a strong spear, with a point of keen
bronze, and stood outside the hut, and straightway beheld a deed of shame, the
Achaians fleeing in rout, and the high-hearted Trojans driving them, and the
wall of the Achaians was overthrown. And as when the great sea is troubled with
a dumb wave, and dimly bodes the sudden paths of the shrill winds, but is still
unmoved nor yet rolled forward or to either side, until some steady gale comes
down from Zeus, even so the old man pondered,—his mind divided this way and
that,—whether he should fare into the press of the Danaans of the swift steeds,
or go after Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host. And thus as he
pondered, it seemed to him the better counsel to go to the son of Atreus.
Meanwhile they were warring and slaying each other, and the stout bronze rang
about their bodies as they were thrust with swords and double-pointed spears.
</p>

<p>
Now the kings, the fosterlings of Zeus, encountered Nestor, as they went up
from the ships, even they that were wounded with the bronze, Tydeus&rsquo; son,
and Odysseus, and Agamemnon, son of Atreus. For far apart from the battle were
their ships drawn up, on the shore of the grey sea, for these were the first
they had drawn up to the plain, but had builded the wall in front of the
hindmost. For in no wise might the beach, for as wide as it was, hold all the ships,
and the host was straitened. Wherefore they drew up the ships row within row,
and filled up the wide mouth of all the shore that the headlands held between
them. Therefore the kings were going together, leaning on their spears, to look
on the war and fray, and the heart of each was sore within his breast. And the
old man met them, even Nestor, and caused the spirit to fail within the breasts
of the Achaians.
</p>

<p>
And mighty Agamemnon spake and accosted him: &ldquo;O Nestor, son of Neleus,
great glory of the Achaians, wherefore dost thou come hither and hast deserted
the war, the bane of men? Lo, I fear the accomplishment of the word that dread
Hector spake, and the threat wherewith he threatened us, speaking in the
assembly of the Trojans, namely, that never would he return to Ilios from the
ships, till he had burned the ships with fire, and slain the men. Even so he
spake, and, lo, now all these things are being fulfilled. Alas, surely even the
other well-greaved Achaians store wrath against me in their hearts, like
Achilles, and have no desire to fight by the rearmost ships.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Nestor of Gerenia the knight answered him saying &ldquo;Verily these
things are now at hand, and being accomplished, nor otherwise could Zeus
himself contrive them, he that thundereth on high. For, lo, the wall is
overthrown, wherein we trusted that it should be an unbroken bulwark of the
ships and of our own bodies. And these men by the swift ships have endless
battle without sparing, and no more couldst thou tell, howsoever closely
thou mightst spy, from what side the Achaians are driven in rout, so confusedly
are they slain, and the cry of battle goeth up to heaven. But let us take counsel, how these things may best
be done, if wit may do aught: but into the war I counsel not that we should go
down, for in no wise may a wounded man do battle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Agamemnon king of men answered him again: &ldquo;Nestor, for that they are
warring by the rearmost ships, and the well-builded wall hath availed not, nor
the trench, whereat the Achaians endured so much labour, hoping in their hearts
that it should be the unbroken bulwark of the ships, and of their own
bodies—such it seemeth must be the will of Zeus supreme, [that the Achaians
should perish here nameless far from Argos]. For I knew it when he was forward
to aid the Danaans, and now I know that he is giving to the Trojans glory like
that of the blessed gods, and hath bound our hands and our strength. But come,
as I declare, let us all obey. Let us drag down the ships that are drawn up in
the first line near to the sea, and speed them all forth to the salt sea
divine, and moor them far out with stones, till the divine night comes, if even
at night the Trojans will refrain from war, and then might we drag down all the
ships. For there is no shame in fleeing from ruin, yea, even in the night.
Better doth he fare who flees from trouble, than he that is overtaken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then, looking on him sternly, spake Odysseus of many counsels:
&ldquo;Atreus&rsquo; son, what word hath passed the door of thy lips? Man of
mischief, sure thou shouldst lead some other inglorious army, not be king among
us, to whom Zeus hath given it, from youth even unto age, to wind the skein of
grievous wars, till every man of us perish. Art thou indeed so eager to leave
the wide-wayed city of the Trojans, the city for which we endure with sorrow so
many evils? Be silent, lest some other of the Achaians hear this word, that no
man should so much as suffer to pass through his mouth, none that understandeth
in his heart how to speak fit counsel, none that is a sceptred king, and hath
hosts obeying him so many as the Argives over whom thou reignest. And now I
wholly scorn thy thoughts, such a word as thou hast uttered, thou that, in the
midst of war and battle, dost bid us draw down the well-timbered ships to the
sea, that even more than ever the Trojans may possess their desire, albeit they
win the mastery even now, and sheer destruction fall upon us. For the Achaians
will not make good the war, when the ships are drawn down to the salt sea, but
will look round about to flee, and withdraw from battle. There will thy counsel
work a mischief, O marshal of the host!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him: &ldquo;Odysseus, right sharply
hast thou touched my heart with thy stern reproof: nay, I do not bid the sons
of the Achaians to drag, against their will, the well-timbered ships to the
salt sea. Now perchance there may be one who will utter a wiser counsel than
this of mine,—a young man or an old,—welcome would it be to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Diomedes of the loud war-cry spake also among them: &ldquo;The man is
near,—not long shall we seek him, if ye be willing to be persuaded of me, and
each of you be not resentful at all, because in years I am the youngest among
you. Nay, but I too boast me to come by lineage of a noble sire, Tydeus, whom
in Thebes the piled-up earth doth cover. For Portheus had three well-born
children, and they dwelt in Pleuron, and steep Kalydon, even Agrios and Melas,
and the third was Oineus the knight, the father of my father, and in valour he
excelled the others. And there he abode, but my father dwelt at Argos, whither
he had wandered, for so Zeus and the other gods willed that it should be. And
he wedded one of the daughters of Adrastos, and dwelt in a house full of
livelihood, and had wheat-bearing fields enow, and many orchards of trees
apart, and many sheep were his, and in skill with the spear he excelled all the
Achaians: these things ye must have heard, if I speak sooth. Therefore ye could
not say that I am weak and a coward by lineage, and so dishonour my spoken
counsel, that well I may speak. Let us go down to the battle, wounded as we
are, since we needs must; and then might we hold ourselves aloof from the
battle, beyond the range of darts, lest any take wound upon wound; but the
others will we spur on, even them that aforetime gave place to their passion,
and stand apart, and fight not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and they all heard him readily, and obeyed him. And they set
forth, led by Agamemnon the king of men.
</p>

<p>
Now the renowned Earth-shaker held no vain watch, but went with them in the
guise of an ancient man, and he seized the right hand of Agamemnon,
Atreus&rsquo; son, and uttering winged words he spake to him, saying:
&ldquo;Atreides, now methinks the ruinous heart of Achilles rejoices in his
breast, as he beholds the slaughter and flight of the Achaians, since he hath
no wisdom, not a grain. Nay, even so may he perish likewise, and god mar him.
But with thee the blessed gods are not utterly wroth, nay, even yet methinks
the leaders and rulers of the Trojans will cover the wide plain with dust, and
thyself shalt see them fleeing to the city from the ships and the huts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, and shouted mightily, as he sped over the plain. And loud as nine
thousand men, or ten thousand cry in battle, when they join the strife of war,
so mighty was the cry that the strong Shaker of the earth sent forth from his
breast, and great strength he put into the heart of each of the Achaians, to
strive and war unceasingly.
</p>

<p>
Now Hera of the golden throne stood on the peak of Olympus, and saw with her
eyes, and anon knew him that was her brother and her lord&rsquo;s going to and
fro through the glorious fight, and she rejoiced in her heart. And she beheld
Zeus sitting on the topmost crest of many-fountained Ida, and to her heart he
was hateful. Then she took thought, the ox-eyed lady Hera, how she might
beguile the mind of aegis-bearing Zeus. And this seemed to her in her heart to
be the best counsel, namely to fare to Ida, when she had well adorned herself,
if perchance he would desire to sleep beside her and embrace her body in love, and
a sweet sleep and a kindly she could pour on his eye lids and his
crafty wits. And she set forth to her bower, that her dear son Hephaistos had
fashioned, and therein had made fast strong doors on the pillars, with a secret
bolt, that no other god might open. There did she enter in and closed the
shining doors. With ambrosia first did she cleanse every stain from her winsome
body, and anointed her with olive oil, ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour;
if it were but shaken, in the bronze-floored mansion of Zeus, the savour
thereof went right forth to earth and heaven. Therewith she anointed her fair
body, and combed her hair, and with her hands plaited her shining tresses, fair
and ambrosial, flowing from her immortal head. Then she clad her in her
fragrant robe that Athene wrought delicately for her, and therein set many
things beautifully made, and fastened it over her breast with clasps of gold.
And she girdled it with a girdle arrayed with a hundred tassels, and she set
earrings in her pierced ears, earrings of three drops, and glistering,
therefrom shone grace abundantly. And with a veil over all the peerless goddess
veiled herself, a fair new veil, bright as the sun, and beneath her shining
feet she bound goodly sandals. But when she had adorned her body with all her
array, she went forth from her bower, and called Aphrodite apart from the other
gods, and spake to her, saying: &ldquo;Wilt thou obey me, dear child, in that
which I shall tell thee? or wilt thou refuse, with a grudge in thy heart,
because I succour the Danaans, and thou the Trojans?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Aphrodite the daughter of Zeus answered her: &ldquo;Hera, goddess queen,
daughter of mighty Kronos, say the thing that is in thy mind, my heart bids me
fulfil it, if fulfil it I may, and if it may be accomplished.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then with crafty purpose the lady Hera answered her: &ldquo;Give me now Love
and Desire wherewith thou dost overcome all the Immortals, and mortal men. For
I am going to visit the limits of the bountiful Earth, and Okeanos, father of
the gods, and mother Tethys, who reared me well and nourished me in their
halls, having taken me from Rhea, when far-seeing Zeus imprisoned Kronos
beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea. Them am I going to visit, and their
endless strife will I loose, for already this long time they hold apart from
each other, apart from love and the marriage bed, since wrath hath settled in their hearts. If with words I might
persuade their hearts, and bring them back to love and the marriage bed, ever should I be called
dear to them and worshipful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then laughter-loving Aphrodite answered her again: &ldquo;It may not be, nor
seemly were it, to deny that thou askest, for thou sleepest in the arms of
Zeus, the chief of gods.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Therewith from her breast she loosed the broidered girdle, fair-wrought,
wherein are all her enchantments; therein are love, and desire, and loving
converse, that steals the wits even of the wise. This girdle she laid in her
hands, and spake, and said: &ldquo;Lo now, take this girdle and lay it up in
thy bosom, this fair-wrought girdle, wherein all things are fashioned; methinks
thou wilt not return with that unaccomplished, which in thy heart thou
desirest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake she, and the ox-eyed lady Hera smiled, and smiling laid up the zone
within her breast.
</p>

<p>
Then the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite, went to her house, and Hera, rushing
down, left the peak of Olympus, and touched on Pieria and pleasant Emathia,
and sped&rsquo; over the snowy hills of the
Thracian horsemen, even over the topmost crests, nor grazed the ground with her
feet, and from Athos she fared across the foaming sea, and came to Lemnos, the
city of godlike Thoas. There she met Sleep, the brother of Death, and clasped
her hand in his, and spake and called him by name: &ldquo;Sleep, lord of all
gods and of all men, if ever thou didst hear my word, obey me again even now,
and I will be grateful to thee always. Lull me, I pray thee, the shining eyes
of Zeus beneath his brows, so soon as I have laid me down by him in love.
And gifts I will give to thee, even a fair throne,
imperishable for ever, a golden throne, that Hephaistos the Lame, mine own
child, shall fashion skilfully, and will set beneath it a footstool for the
feet, for thee to set thy shining feet upon, when thou art at a festival.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then sweet Sleep answered her and said: &ldquo;Hera, goddess and queen, daughter
of mighty Kronos, another of the eternal gods might I lightly lull to slumber,
yea, were it the streams of Okeanos himself, that is the father of them all. But
to Zeus the son of Kronos might I not draw near, nor lull him to slumber, unless
himself commanded it. For ere now did a behest of thine teach me a lesson, on the
day when that famed high-hearted son of Zeus sailed from Ilios, when he had sacked
the city of the Trojans. Then verily I lulled the soul of aegis-bearing Zeus, with
my sweet influence poured about him, and thou didst contrive evil against him in thy heart, and didst rouse over the sea the blasts of violent winds, and Herakles
thou then didst bear to well-peopled Kos, far from all his friends. But Zeus, when
he wakened, was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion, and me above all
he sought, and he would have cast me from the upper air to perish in the deep, if
Night had not saved me, Night, that subdues both gods and men. To her I came as a
suppliant in my flight, and he ceased from pursuing, wrathful as he was, for he was
in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night. And now again thou biddest me
accomplish this other task that may not be accomplished.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the ox-eyed lady Hera answered him again: &ldquo;Sleep, wherefore dost thou
consider these things in thy heart? dost thou deem that Zeus of the far-borned voice
will succour the Trojans even as he was wroth for the sake of Herakles, his own child? Nay
come, and I will give thee one of the younger of the Graces, to wed and to be
called thy wife [even Pasithea, that ever thou longest for all thy days].&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So she spake, and Sleep was glad, and answered and said: &ldquo;Come now, swear
to me by the inviolable water of Styx, and with one of thy hands grasp the
bounteous earth, and with the other the shining sea, that all may be witnesses
to us, even all the gods below that are with Kronos, that verily thou wilt give
me one of the younger of the Graces, even Pasithea, that myself do long for all
my days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, nor did she disobey, the white-armed goddess Hera; she sware as he
bade her, and called all the gods by name, even those below Tartaros that are
called Titans. But when she had sworn and ended that oath, the twain left the
citadel of Lemnos, and of Imbros, clothed on in mist, and swiftly they
accomplished the way. To many-fountained Ida they came, the mother of wild
beasts, to Lekton, where first they left the sea, and they twain fared above
the dry land, and the topmost forest waved beneath their feet. There Sleep
halted, ere the eyes of Zeus beheld him, and alighted on a tall pine tree, the
loftiest pine that then in all Ida rose through the nether to the upper air.
Therein sat he, hidden by the branches of the pine, in the likeness of the
shrill brid that on the mountains the gods call <em>chalkis</em>, but men <em>kymindis</em>.*
But Hera swiftly drew nigh to topmost Gargaros, the highest crest of Ida, and
Zeus the cloud-gatherer beheld her. And as he saw her, so love came over his
deep heart, even as when first they mingled with each other in delight, and
went together to the couch, their dear parents knowing it not. And he stood
before her, and spoke, and said: &ldquo;Hera, with
what desire comest thou thus hither from Olympus, and thy horses and chariot
are not here, whereon thou mightst ascend?&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">

for this bird, which is really a kind of swift. - R. W. R.
</p>

<p>
Then with crafty purpose lady Hera answered him: &ldquo;I am going to visit the
limits of the bountiful Earth, and Okeanos, father of the gods, and mother
Tethys, who reared me well and cherished me in their halls. Them am I going to
visit, and their endless strife will I loose, for already this long time they
hold apart from each other, from love and the marriage bed,
since wrath hath settled in their hearts. But my
horses are standing at the foot of many-fountained Ida, my horses that shall
bear me over wet and dry. And now it is because of thee that I am thus come
hither, down from Olympus, lest perchance thou mightest be wroth with me
hereafter, if silently I were gone to the mansion of deep-flowing
Okeanos.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, answered her and said: &ldquo;Hera,
thither mayst thou go on a later day. But come let us twain take pleasure in
the bed of love. For never once as thus did the love of
goddess or woman so mightily overflow and conquer the heart within my
breast. Not when I loved the wife of Ixion, who bore Pirithoos, the peer of gods
in counsel, nor when I loved Danae of the fair ankles, daughter of Akrisios, who
bore Perseus, most renowned of all men, nor when I loved the famed daughter of
Phoinix, who bore me Minos, and godlike Rhadamanthys, nay, nor even when I loved
Semele, nor Alkmene in Thebes, and she bore Herakles, a child hardy of heart, but
Semele bore Dionysos, a delight to mortals, nay, nor when I loved the fair-tressed
queen, Demeter, nor renowned Leto, nay, nor thy very self, as now I love thee, and sweet desire possesses me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And him the lady Hera answered with craft purpose: &ldquo;Most dread son of Kronos,
what a word thou hast spoken! If now thou dost long to be couched in love on the crests of Ida, and all stands plain to view, how would it be if someone of the
eternal gods should see us slumbering, and go and tell it to all the gods? It is
not I that could arise from the couch and go again to thy house, nay, it would
be a thing for righteous anger. But if thou wilt, and it is dear to thy heart,
thou hast a chamber that thine own son Hephaistos builded, and fastened strong
doors to the pillars, thither let us go and lie down, if the couch be thy
desire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered her and said: &ldquo;Hera, fear not lest any god, or any man should spy the thing, so great a golden cloud will I cast all over
thee. Nay, methinks not even the sun might see through it, the sun, whose light
is keenest of all to behold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, and the son of Kronos clasped his consort in his arms. And beneath
them the divine earth sent forth fresh new grass, and dewy lotus, and crocus, and
hyacinth, thick and soft, that raised them aloft from the ground. Therein they
lay, and were clad on with a fair golden cloud, whence fell drops of glittering
dew.
</p>

<p>
Thus slept the Father in quiet on the crest of Gargaros, by Sleep and love
overcome, with his bedfellow in his arms.
But sweet Sleep started and ran to the ships of the Achaians, to tell
his tidings to the god that holdeth and shaketh the earth. And he stood near
him, and spake winged words: &ldquo;Eagerly now, Poseidon, do thou aid the
Danaans, and give them glory for a little space, while yet Zeus sleepeth, for
over him have I shed soft slumber, and Hera hath beguiled him to couch in
love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and passed to the renowned tribes of men, and still the more did
he set on Poseidon to aid the Danaans, who straightway sprang far afront of the
foremost, and called to them: &ldquo;Argives, are we again to yield the victory
to Hector, son of Priam, that he may take our ships and win renown? Nay, even
so he saith and declareth that he will do, for that Achilles by the hollow
ships abides angered at heart. But for him there will be no such extreme
regret, if we spur us on to aid each the other. Nay come, as I command, let us
all obey. Let us harness us in the best shields that are in the host, and the
greatest, and cover our heads with shining helms, and take the longest spears
in our hands, and so go forth. Yea, and I will lead the way, and methinks that
Hector, son of Priam, will not long await us, for all his eagerness. And
whatsoever man is steadfast in battle, and hath a small buckler on his
shoulder, let him give it to a worse man, and harness him in a larger
shield.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, and they heard him eagerly and obeyed him. And them the kings
themselves arrayed, wounded as they were, Tydeus&rsquo; son, and Odysseus, and
Agamemnon, son of Atreus. They went through all the host, and made exchange of
weapons of war. The good arms did the good warrior harness him in, the worse he
gave to the worse. But when they had done on the shining bronze about their
bodies, they started on the march, and Poseidon led them, the Shaker of the
earth, with a dread sword of fine edge in his strong hand, like unto lightning;
wherewith it is not permitted that any should mingle in woful war, but fear
holds men afar therefrom. But the Trojans on the other side was renowned Hector
arraying. Then did they now strain the fiercest strife of war, even dark-haired
Poseidon and glorious Hector, one succouring the Trojans, the other with the
Argives. And the sea washed up to the huts and ships of the Argives, and they
gathered together with a mighty cry. Not so loudly bellows the wave of the sea
against the land, stirred up from the deep by the harsh breath of the north
wind, nor so loud is the roar of burning fire in the glades of a mountain, when
it springs to burn up the forest, nor calls the wind so loudly in the high
leafy tresses of the trees, when it rages and roars its loudest, as then was
the cry of the Trojans and Achaians, shouting dreadfully as they rushed upon
each other.
</p>

<p>
First glorious Hector cast with his spear at Aias, who was facing him full, and
did not miss, striking him where two belts were stretched across his breast,
the belt of his shield, and of his silver-studded sword; these guarded his
tender flesh. And Hector was enraged because his swift spear had flown vainly
from his hand, and he retreated into the throng of his fellows, avoiding Fate.
</p>

<p>
Then as he was departing the great Telamonian Aias smote him with a huge stone;
for many stones, the props of swift ships, were rolled among the feet of the
fighters; one of these he lifted, and smote Hector on the breast, over the
shield-rim, near the neck, and made him spin like a top with the blow, that he
reeled round and round. And even as when an oak falls uprooted beneath the
stroke of father Zeus, and a dread savour of brimstone arises therefrom, and
whoso stands near and beholds it has no more courage, for dread is the bolt of
great Zeus, even so fell mighty Hector straightway in the dust. And the spear
fell from his hand, but his shield and helm were made fast to him, and round
him rang his arms adorned with bronze.
</p>

<p>
Then with a loud cry they ran up, the sons of the Achaians, hoping to drag him
away, and they cast showers of darts. But not one availed to wound or smite the
shepherd of the host, before that might be the bravest gathered about him,
Polydamas, and Aineias, and goodly Agenor, and Sarpedon, leader of the Lykians,
and noble Glaukos, and of the rest not one was heedless of him, but they held
their round shields in front of him, and his comrades lifted him in their arms,
and bare him out of the battle, till he reached his swift horses that were
standing waiting for him, with the charioteer and the fair-dight chariot at the
rear of the combat and the war. These toward the city bore him heavily moaning.
Now when they came to the ford of the fair-flowing river, of eddying Xanthos,
that immortal Zeus begat, there they lifted him from the chariot to the ground,
and poured water over him, and he gat back his breath, and looked up with his
eyes, and sitting on his heels kneeling, he vomited black blood. Then again he
sank back on the ground, and black night covered his eyes, the stroke still
conquering his spirit.
</p>

<p>
Now the Argives when they saw Hector departed rushed yet the more upon the Trojans,
and were mindful of the delight of battle. There far the foremost did swift Aias,
son of Oileus, leap on Satnios, son of Enops, and wounded him with his sharp
spear; Satnios whom the fair Naiad-nymph bore to Enops as he herded his flocks by
the banks of Satnioeis. Him did the spear-famed son of Oileus draw nigh, and
wounded him on the flank, and he fell, and round him did Trojans and Danaans join
in strong battle. Then to his aid came Polydamas, the wielder of the spear, son of
Panthoos, and smote Prothoenor on the right shoulder, Prothoenor, son of
Areïlykos, and through his shoulder went the mighty spear, and he fell in
the dust, and clutched the earth with his palm. And Polydamas boasted over him
terribly, crying aloud: &ldquo;Verily methinks that again from the strong hand
of the high-hearted son of Panthoos, the spear hath not leaped in vain. Nay, one of
the Argives hath caught it in his flesh, and leaning thereon for a staff, methinks
that he will go down within the house of Hades.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spake he, and sorrow came on the Argives by reason of his boasting. And chiefly
he roused the wrath of the wise son of Telamon, Aias, for the man fell close by
him. Swiftly he cast at the other, as he departed, with his shining spear. And
Polydamas himself avoided black Fate, starting to one side, but Archelochos, son
of Antenor, received the spear, for the gods had willed his death. Him the spear
struck at the meeting of the head and neck, on the last joint of the spine, and
cut in twain both the tendons. And his head, and mouth, and nose, as he fell,
reached the earth long before his legs and knees, and Aias again shouted to noble
Polydamas: &ldquo;Consider, Polydamas, and tell me truly, whether thou sayst not
that this man is worth slaying in place of Prothoenor: he seems to me no coward,
nor born of cowards, but a brother of horse-taming Antenor, or a child, for
he most closely favoureth his house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, knowing the truth right well, and sorrow seized the hearts of the
Trojans. Then Akamas wounded Promachos the Boiotian with his spear, from where he
stodd above his brother, that Promachos was dragging away by the feet. Over him
Akamas boasted terribly, shouting aloud: &ldquo;Ye Argive bowmen, insatiate of
threats, verily not for us alone shall there be struggle and toil, nay, but even
as we shall ye likewise perish. Consider how your Promachos sleepeth, vanquished
by my spear, that my brother's blood-price may not be long unpaid. Even for this
it is that a man may well pray to leave some kinsman in his halls, that will
avenge his fall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and sorrow came on the Argives at his boast. And chiefly he stirred
the heart of the wise Peneleos, who made for Akamas, and Akamas abode not the
onset of the prince Peneleos. But Peneleos wounded Ilioneus, the son of Phorbas,
rich in herds, that Hermes loved most dearly of all the Trojans, and gave him
wealth. Now his mother bare Ilioneus, an only child, to Phorbas. Him did Peneleos
wound beneath the brows, at the bases of the eye, and drave out the eyeball, and
the spear went clean through the eye and through the nape of the neck, and he fell
back, stretching out both his hands. And Peneleos, drawing forth his sharp sword,
smote him on the middle of the neck, and smote off even to the ground the head
with the helmet, and still the strong spear stood in the eye, and lifting it up
like a poppy head, he showed it to the Trojans, and spoke his boastful words:
&ldquo;Ye Trojans, I pray you bid the dear father and the mother of proud Ilioneus
to wail in their halls, for neither will the wife of Promachos, son of Alegenor,
rejoice in her dear husband's coming, in that hour when we youths of the Achaians
return with our ships out of Troy-land.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and fear fell on the limbs of all of them; and each man looked about
to see where he might flee sheer destruction.
</p>

<p>
Tell me now, ye Muses, that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who was the first
of the Achaians to lift the bloody spoils, when once the renowned Shaker of the
earth turned the battle.
</p>

<p>
Verily it was Aias, son of Telamon, that first wounded Hyrtios, the son of
Gyrtias, the leader of the Mysians strong of heart, and Antilochos stripped
the spoils from Phalkes and Mermeros, and Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion, and
Teukros slew Prothoon and Periphetes, and next Atreus' son wounded in the flank
Hyperenor, the shepherd of the host, and the bronze point tore through and let
out the entrails, and the soul through the stricken wound fled hastily, and
darkness covered his eyes. But most men did Aias slay, the swift-footed son of
Oileus, for there was none so speedy of foot as he, to follow when men fled, when
Zeus sent terror among them.
