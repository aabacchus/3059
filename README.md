# CORRECTION OF PG #3059: THE ILIAD, BY HOMER
## translated by Andrew Lang, Walter Leaf, and Ernest Meyers

The existing (as of 2021-12-29) eBook #3059 is a transcription of the ABRIDGED
version of the above text. This is a project to add the missing words so that
eBook #3059 becomes a digitization of the REVISED (and complete) version, while
the abridged version will be saved under a new eBook number.

The directory 3059-orig/ contains the original (abridged) texts.
I am correcting books 13 to 24.

The \*\_lines\*.txt files are the two revisions, with each word on a single line,
for comparison.
